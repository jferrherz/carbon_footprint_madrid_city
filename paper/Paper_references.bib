	abstract = {Over the past few years, Voluntary Local Reviews (VLRs) have become a common tool for local and regional governments (LRGs) to monitor local achievements and implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Many LRGs rely on policy analysis and quantitative data to assess initiatives and regulations in several SDG-related policy fields. While working on its own VLR, the City of Madrid published in March 2021 its Roadmap to Climate Neutrality by 2050. The Roadmap was a valuable policy document because it gave insight on a fully local long-term policy strategy on a sensitive policy issue such as decarbonisation and climate change. This report studies the process that led to the Roadmap, highlighting the links between the document and Madrid's longstanding tradition of regulation on greenhouse gas emissions, climate change mitigation, and other decarbonisation measures. It also studies how the Roadmap - a planning document on a specific sustainability issue - compares to existing VLRs from Europe and elsewhere in terms of selected indicators, collected data, and policy lines of action. This information can help define a 'localised' concept of climate neutrality and assess whether a genuinely local approach to decarbonisation currently exists, and how this fits with the targets identified by the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda at the global level.

Second, we investigate how rising household income influences the manner in which total expenditure is distributed across Engel's expenditure categories. Our results suggest that i) total household expenditure is distributed across Engel's expenditure categories in an increasingly even manner as household income increases and ii) over time, there has been an acceleration in the rate at which household expenditure patterns become diversified as household income rises. Finally, we consider how the shape of Engel Curves may help shed light on the relationship between goods and the underlying needs they serve.},

They provide a basis for estimating the degree to which observed environmental improvements, which come in part from changing consumption patterns, can be attributed to income growth. We calculate a set of annual EECs for the United States from 1984 to 2002, revealing three clear results. First, EECs are upward sloping: richer households are indirectly responsible for more pollution. Second, EECs are convex, with income elasticities of less than one. Third, EECs have been shifting down over time: at every level of income households are responsible for decreasing amounts of pollution. We show that even without changes to production techniques, the pollution necessary to produce the goods and services American households consume would have declined 5 to 8 percent, despite a 13 percent increase in real household incomes. Most of this improvement is attributable to households consuming a less pollution-intensive mix of goods, driven about equally by two factors: household income growth represented by movement along convex EECs; and economy-wide changes represented by downward shifts in EECs.},

However, more diversity of household types is needed to analyse the effects of multiple phenomena (i.e. ageing, gender inequality, distributional income impact, etc.). Household consumption surveys' microdata is a rich data source for these types of analysis. However, feeding multisectoral models with this type of information is not simple and recent studies show how even slightly inaccurate procedures might result in significantly biased results. This paper presents the full procedure for feeding household consumption microdata into macroeconomic models and for the first time provides in a systematic way an estimation of the bridge matrices needed to link European Union Household Budget Surveys' microdata with the most popular multi-regional input-- output frameworks (e.g. Eurostat, WIOD, EORA, OECD).},

National Accounts (NA) describe the economic behaviour of the average household. However, they do not investigate the heterogeneity of the sector. Average values can conceal signifcantly diferent living standards. Average per capita consumption, for example, may remain unchanged, while the distribution of consumption becomes more uneven. Likewise, dynamics in the distribution of income remain hidden in the NA averages. On the other hand, NA follow a methodology harmonised at global level (the System of National Accounts) and are thus generally comparable worldwide. Comparability is even better among EU countries due to the European System of National and Regional Accounts (ESA), which provides a common legal basis for the EU (Eurostat 1999, 2013). Another advantage of NA is that all possible forms of economic resources are detected, including those deliberately concealed (shadow economy). Finally, NA provide fully consistent and comprehensible data on income, consumption and wealth},

We find that households in smaller municipalities have a larger total carbon footprint due to their higher direct emissions. Although their consumption is lower than other municipalities, they have a more intensive pattern of embedded carbon consumption. Households in smaller municipalities spend a higher share in private transport and housing-related activities, emitting almost an additional ton of direct carbon emissions.},

  abstract = {While the EU Commission has encouraged Member States to combine national and international climate change mitigation measures with subnational environmental policies, there has been little harmonized effort towards the quantification of embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from household consumption across European regions. This study develops an inventory of carbon footprints associated with household consumption for 177 regions in 27 EU countries, thus, making a key contribution for the incorporation of consumption-based accounting into local decision-making. Footprint calculations are based on consumer expenditure surveys and environmental and trade detail from the EXIOBASE 2.3 multiregional input-output database describing the world economy in 2007 at the detail of 43 countries, 5 rest-of-the-world regions and 200 product sectors. Our analysis highlights the spatial heterogeneity of embodied GHG emissions within multiregional countries with subnational ranges varying widely between 0.6 and 6.5 tCO2e/cap. The significant differences in regional contribution in terms of total and per capita emissions suggest notable differences with regards to climate change responsibility. The study further provides a breakdown of regional emissions by consumption categories (e.g. housing, mobility, food). In addition, our region-level study evaluates driving forces of carbon footprints through a set of socio-economic, geographic and technical factors. Income is singled out as the most important driver for a region's carbon footprint, although its explanatory power varies significantly across consumption domains. Additional factors that stand out as important on the regional level include household size, urban-rural typology, level of education, expenditure patterns, temperature, resource availability and carbon intensity of the electricity mix. The lack of cross-national region-level studies has so far prevented analysts from drawing broader policy conclusions that hold beyond national and regional borders.},

Using a novel method of creating city-level input--output tables, we present the first consistent, large-scale, and global assessment of three-scope GHG inventories for 79 members of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. These inventories cover the emissions from sources located within city boundaries (Scope 1), emissions occurring as a consequence of the use of grid-supplied electricity, heat, steam, and/or cooling (Scope 2), and all other GHG emissions that occur outside the city boundary as a result of activities taking place within the city (Scope 3). We find that, by only accounting for territorial emissions, without Scope 3, the 79 C40 cities under-report 4\% of global annual GHG emissions from six key infrastructure-related transboundary sources (73\%) and from service-related sectors (27\%). In contrast, when only accounting for consumption-based emissions, the C40 cities would miss the mitigation target on 41\% of their territorial emissions. We argue that cities should complement their GHG inventories, adding full Scope 3 to Scopes 1 and 2, and develop low-carbon consumption strategies in addition to current infrastructure-focused action on climate change.},

Using the new EXIOBASE 2.2 multiregional input-output database, which describes the world economy at the detail of 43 countries, five rest-of-the-world regions, and 200 product sectors, we are able to trace the origin of the products consumed by households and represent global supply chains for 2007. We highlight the importance of environmental pressure arising from households with their consumption contributing to more than 60\% of global GHG emissions and between 50\% and 80\% of total land, material, and water use. The footprints are unevenly distributed across regions, with wealthier countries generating the most significant impacts per capita. Elasticities suggest a robust and significant relationship between households' expenditure and their environmental impacts, driven by a rising demand of nonprimary consumption items. Mobility, shelter, and food are the most important consumption categories across the environmental footprints. Globally, food accounts for 48\% and 70\% of household impacts on land and water resources, respectively, with consumption of meat, dairy, and processed food rising fast with income. Shelter and mobility stand out with high carbon and material intensity, whereas the significance of services for footprints relates to the large amount of household expenditure associated with them.},

Much attention has been focused on the CO 2 directly emitted by each country, but relatively little attention has been paid to the amount of emissions associated with the consumption of goods and services in each country. Consumption-based accounting of CO 2 emissions differs from traditional, production-based inventories because of imports and exports of goods and services that, either directly or indirectly, involve CO 2 emissions. Here, using the latest available data, we present a global consumption-based CO 2 emissions inventory and calculations of associated consumption-based energy and carbon intensities. We find that, in 2004, 23\% of global CO 2 emissions, or 6.2 gigatonnes CO 2 , were traded internationally, primarily as exports from China and other emerging markets to consumers in developed countries. In some wealthy countries, including Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, the United Kingdom, and France, {$>$}30\% of consumption-based emissions were imported, with net imports to many Europeans of {$>$}4 tons CO 2 per person in 2004. Net import of emissions to the United States in the same year was somewhat less: 10.8\% of total consumption-based emissions and 2.4 tons CO 2 per person. In contrast, 22.5\% of the emissions produced in China in 2004 were exported, on net, to consumers elsewhere. Consumption-based accounting of CO 2 emissions demonstrates the potential for international carbon leakage. Sharing responsibility for emissions among producers and consumers could facilitate international agreement on global climate policy that is now hindered by concerns over the regional and historical inequity of emissions.},

Results show that the dominant categories influencing the indirect environmental footprint in 2015 are (1) food and beverages, (2) housing, and (3) furnishings. From the intensity perspective, housing, transport, and food and beverages appear to be the most intensive consumption clusters in the Spanish household indirect environmental footprint. In relation to the indirect water impacts embodied in the Spanish households' imports, the largest amount is from European countries and the highest virtual water (59\%) corresponds to food and agriculture, in particular from wheat, fruit, vegetables, and dairy products. The findings obtained in relation to the sources generating indirect impacts from household consumption could aid the implementation of future mitigation policies.},

The analysis is based on a multi-regional input--output model, which allows us to estimate life-cycle emissions for all major household consumption items. Results demonstrate that household carbon footprints in all the Baltic States significantly increased by 47\% in Estonia, 20\% in Latvia and 52\% in Lithuania during the study period. In 2011 in Estonia expenditures for housing and utility contributed the highest per capita life-cycle emissions --43\%. However, in Lithuania housing accounted only for 16\% of per capita emissions, but food and transport were responsible for 31\%; whereas in Estonia and Latvia transport accounted for 18\% and 21\%, respectively. Production processes related to food consumption are responsible for 18\% of emissions in Estonia, 31\% in Latvia and Lithuania. Most of the indirect emissions are related to imports from Russia and China followed by imports from other Baltic States. If consumption-based emissions are to decrease countries will have to (1) change household behavior, which requires relevant knowledge, infrastructure and resources to facilitate switching to lower carbon-intensive alternatives; (2) decarbonize their own energy and transport sectors; and (3) reduce lifecycle emissions associated with trade, by supporting imports from low carbon regions, including producing locally.},

While the Multi Regional Input-Output analysis has been accepted by the scientific community as an alternative to the IPCC accounting, some concerns arise from the feasibility and the actual implementation of this methodology. In this paper, we apply a simplified framework recently introduced by Caro et al. (2014a), called NCI (National Carbon Intensity) method, and estimate the total CO2 emissions due to consumption in 175 countries during the period 2008e2012, with a focus on the Mediterranean area. We estimate CO2 emissions embodied in trade, assigning emission responsibility on the basis of each country's demand. Globally in 2012, 8129 Mt CO2 emissions were related to goods produced in one country and consumed outside its boundaries. A relevant example is the export from China to consumers located in the USA, Japan, and Germany. A focus on the Mediterranean area, that resulted as a net importer of CO2 embodied in traded goods, identifies the export of emissions from Italy and Spain to France and from Libya and Algeria to Italy as the dominant flows. The NCI method provides a realistic picture of emissions due to consumption that differs from high resolution Multi Regional Input-Output database by less than 10\%. The method can be largely adopted as a more feasible preliminary step towards consumption-based emission accounting and responsibility assignment.},

We identify several important relationships in bilateral carbon flows, including China--EU, China--USA, Russia--EU, and China--Japan, which make China and Russia the largest carbon exporters and the EU and the USA the largest carbon importers. A further investigation of the sectors contributing to carbon flows shows that exports from the mineral, chemicals, metals, oil, transport, and other manufacturing sectors are the main cause of carbon outflows, while the intermediate inputs of the electricity and transport sectors are the primary cause of carbon outflows due to export production. Moreover, we propose an intensity-based shared responsibility strategy and find that China should take the most responsibility because it is responsible for nearly 32\% of all embodied emissions, due to its less efficient and high carbon-intensive technologies. The USA and the EU follow China, with shares of 13.2\% and 11.3\%, respectively, owing to their heavy consumption. As a result, China and the USA contribute 31.8\% and 20.6\%, respectively, of the total global emissions, outweighing the aggregated contribution from all other countries/regions.},

Studies of economic factors embodied in trade have shown that regional technology differences are important for modeling of international trade patterns. Therefor, it is likely that calculations of pollution embodied in international trade will require the consideration of regional technology differences. This article develops a framework based on input-output analysis (IOA) for calculating production factors and pollution embodied in trade. In its most general form, the model has significant data requirements.

In this paper, we present the latest developments realized with EXIOBASE 3---a time series of EE MRIO tables ranging from 1995 to 2011 for 44 countries (28 EU member plus 16 major economies) and five rest of the world regions.

In order to capture structural changes, economic developments, as reported by national statistical agencies, were imposed on the available, disaggregated SUTs from EXIOBASE 2. These initial estimates were further refined by incorporating detailed data on energy, agricultural production, resource extraction, and bilateral trade. EXIOBASE 3 inherits the high level of environmental stressor detail from its precursor, with further improvement in the level of detail for resource extraction. To account for the expansion of the European Union (EU), EXIOBASE 3 was developed with the full EU28 country set (including the new member state Croatia).

The indicators have been designed aiming at: building a Life cycle assessment-based framework for monitoring of sustainable production and consumption (e.g. in relation to the Sustainable Development Goal 12). The methodology allows assessing 16 environmental impacts from three different perspectives: end-consumer product groups level;areas of consumption (food, housing, mobility, consumer goods, and appliances); the average EU consumer; developing a single headline indicator to monitor the evolution of the overall environmental impacts of EU consumption and production at Member State level, as well as the progress towards decoupling economic growth from environmental impacts. The single headline indicator is the results of weighting the 16 indicators mentioned above; testing ecoinnovation scenarios along the supply chains, from extraction of raw materials, to consumer behaviour, up to end of life options. Main results indicate that the EU can be considered a "net importer of environmental impacts". This implies that the Consumption Footprint (overall impacts related to consumption of good and services, including trade) is higher than the Domestic Footprint (impacts generated in the EU area). Five areas of consumption (food, mobility, housing, household goods, and appliances) have been assessed through the Life Cycle Assessment of more than 130 representative products. Consumption of food emerged as one of the main driver of impacts generated by household consumption, followed by housing (especially for space heating) and mobility (especially the use of private cars). Consumer Footprint was increasing between 2010 and 2015, at a rate of 6\% over the 5 years. The environmental impact of the consumption of an average EU citizen is outside the safe operating space for humanity for several impact categories, namely climate change, resource use (fossils fuels, minerals and metals), freshwater eutrophication, photochemical ozone formation, land use, and particulate matter. Despite the differences in the robustness of the impact categories, results conclude that for most categories the impacts are close (if not over) to the planetary boundary},

  abstract = {Towards assessing the environmental domestic impacts of production and consumption activities in the European Union (EU), the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (EC-JRC) developed the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)-based Domestic Footprint indicator. The Domestic Footprint aims at assessing the environmental impacts associated to emissions and resource extraction occurring within a Member State boundary (or the whole EU boundary) by adopting a productionand territorial-based perspective. Therefore, it accounts for both production and consumption activities taking place within the Member State's domestic territory, e.g., from economic sectors such as industry, agriculture, energy, mining, and services; and also encompass those impacts from households and government's activities (e.g., transport, heating). It is meant to be used in association with the consumption footprint, which instead account for the trade-related impacts as well. Both indicators are essential for providing integrated assessment, e.g. in the context of zero pollution. Assessing the Domestic Footprint of individual Member States and the EU allows for identification of environmental hotspots, setting baseline for monitoring of environmental performance progresses and against which testing policy options and scenarios. Domestic footprint focuses exclusively to what is happening within MS boundaries. The Domestic Footprint builds upon an extensive and integrated data collection of detailed information of emissions to the environment (air, water and soil) and resource extraction within the EU and Member State boundaries. This results into a comprehensive inventory of the environmental pressures due to domestic production and consumption. This inventory is then characterized with the Environmental Footprint (EF reference package 3.0), including 16 environmental impact categories which can be presented as individual impacts as well as normalised and weighted into a single score. This report, building upon previous JRC studies, expands the assessment and details the updated methodological approach for the data collection of the Domestic Footprint indicator for each impact category. The exercise entailed a systematic review of data sources and collected data. Furthermore, the assessment of the Domestic Footprint at both the EU and Member States level for the period 2000-2018 is presented, including an analysis of the decoupling of environmental impacts from economic growth and the assessment of the domestic footprint against the Planetary Boundaries (PBs). The EU Domestic Footprint showed a steady decrease for the period 2000-2018, confirming an absolute decoupling of domestic environmental impacts from economic growth. Most of the impact categories also showed absolute decoupling for this period, barring mineral resource use and land use which increased along time although at a slower pace than the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), leading to relative decoupling. Considering an absolute sustainability perspective, the EU Domestic Footprint transgresses the PBs on climate change and particulate matter (being both in the high-risk area), and the PB regarding fossil resources (being in the uncertainty area). Member States showed a different contribution to the EU Domestic Footprint and to the different impact categories. The role of individual countries and their differences in impact per capita depended on the level of economic growth, the technological context (e.g., energy technologies and electricity market) and the availability of natural resources. Three impact categories contributed the most to the EU Domestic Footprint single score: climate change, particulate matter and human toxicity, non-cancer. An analysis at the elementary flow level (i.e. environmental pressures) unveiled that: i.) several impact indicators are driven by a few environmental pressures (i.e., resources used, or substances emitted to the environment), ii.) some environmental pressures contribute to diverse environmental impacts (such as NOx contributing to acidification, eutrophication marine, particulate matter), and iii.) some environmental pressures are resulting from the same anthropic activities (e.g., agricultural production, combustion of fossil fuels)},

  abstract = {The transition towards more sustainable food systems is one of the great challenges at global level. While environmental considerations have been widely explored, the social sustainability of agri-food systems have been scarcely addressed in literature, especially regarding the externalization of impacts due to international trade. In this study, we apply Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) to address social sustainability considerations of food production and consumption, supporting the monitoring of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Building on the model of the Consumption Footprint developed by the EC-JRC to address environmental sustainability aspects, this paper presents a macro-scale assessment of social risk associated with the EU food consumption. In the context of operationalizing value chain assessment within SDGs, the analysis combines social indicators with production, trade and consumption data, allowing the evaluation of the social footprint of European food production and consumption. Selected social indicators and impact subcategories from those available in the Product Social Impact Life Cycle Assessment (PSILCA) database were employed to assess a process-based Life Cycle Inventory model of EU food consumption by means of 44 representative products selected for the EU Consumption Footprint indicators. The assessment included an evaluation of SDGs coverage by S-LCA indicators and a sensitivity analysis based on two different weighting schemes, which unveiled the need of a harmonized weighting approach. Unlike the environmental impacts, social hotspots emerge mainly in rice and fruit \& vegetables categories. Hotspots are concentrated in India, Argentina, and other extra EU countries. These results suggest that trade-offs could emerge between the different sustainability pillars and that fair trade and responsible sourcing approaches should be guaranteed in order to promote sustainable food systems. {\copyright} 2022 The Author(s).

  abstract = {Abstract Urban regions are responsible for a significant proportion of carbon emissions. The carbon footprint (CF) is a practical measure to identify the responsibility of individuals, cities, or nations in climate change. Numerous CF studies have focused on national accounts, and a few combined consumer consumption and global supply chains to estimate additionally detailed spatial CF. However, the drivers of temporal change in detailed spatial CF are largely unknown, along with regional, spatial, and socioeconomic disparities. Here, we uncovered the drivers of changes in household CFs in EU regions, at the finest scale currently available, between 2010 and 2015. This study mapped the household CFs of 83 macro-regions across 27 EU nations and identified the driving factors underlying their temporal change. We combined multi-regional input-output tables and micro-consumption data from 275 247 and 272 045 households in 2010 and 2015, respectively. We decomposed EU regional CF, employing structural decomposition analysis, into five driving factors: emission intensity, supply chain structure, population, per capita consumption, and final demand share. For a deeper assessment of changes in the contribution of consumption patterns, we further categorized the regional CF into 15 factors, including 11 per capita consumption categories. We found that household CF drivers vary depending on region, population density, income, and consumption patterns. Our results can help policymakers adopt climate policies at the regional level by reflecting on the residents' socioeconomic, spatial, and consumption conditions, for further ambitious climate actions.},

Cities not only constitute major centers of economic activity, knowledge, innovation, and governance---they are also said to be linked to approximately 70\% to 80\% of global carbon dioxide emissions. This makes cities primary agents of change in a resource- and carbon-constraint world. In order to set meaningful targets, design successful policies, and implement effective mitigation strategies, it is important that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions accounting for cities is accurate, comparable, comprehensive, and complete. Despite recent developments in the standardization of city GHG accounting, there is still a lack of consistent guidelines regarding out-of-boundary emissions, thus hampering efforts to identify mitigation priorities and responsibilities. We introduce a new conceptual framework---based on environmental input-output analysis---that allows for a consistent and complete reconciliation of direct and indirect GHG emissions from a city. The ``city carbon map'' shows local, regional, national, and global origins and destinations of flows of embodied emissions. We test the carbon map concept by applying it to the greater metropolitan area of Melbourne, Australia. We discuss the results and limitations of the approach in the light of possible mitigation strategies and policies by different urban stakeholders.},

The Gridded Global Model of City Footprints (GGMCF) presented here downscales national CFs into a 250 m gridded model using data on population, purchasing power, and existing subnational CF studies from the US, China, EU, and Japan. Studies have shown that CFs are highly concentrated by income, with the top decile of earners driving 30\%--45\% of emissions. Even allowing for significant modeling uncertainties, we find that emissions are similarly concentrated in a small number of cities. The highest emitting 100 urban areas (defined as contiguous population clusters) account for 18\% of the global carbon footprint. While many of the cities with the highest footprints are in countries with high carbon footprints, nearly one quarter of the top cities (41 of the top 200) are in countries with relatively low emissions. In these cities population and affluence combine to drive footprints at a scale similar to those of cities in high-income countries. We conclude that concerted action by a limited number of local governments can have a disproportionate impact on global emissions.},

  abstract = {Summary Environmentally extended input-output analysis is the prevailing method for national environmental footprint accounting; however, its practical usefulness for consumers and policy makers suffers from lack of detail. Several extensive global multiregional input-output (MRIO) databases have recently been released. A standard framework for linking such databases with the highly detailed household expenditure surveys that are conducted regularly by national statistics offices has the potential of providing analysts in countries worldwide with a powerful tool for in-depth analyses of their national environmental footprints. In this article, we combine the Norwegian consumer expenditure survey with a global MRIO database to assess the carbon footprint (CF) of Norwegian household consumption in 2012, as well as its annual development since 1999. We offer a didactic account of the practical challenges associated with the combination of these types of data sets and the approach taken here to address these, and we discuss what barriers still remain before such analyses can be practically conducted and provide reliable results. We find a CF of 22.3 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents per household in 2012, a 26\% increase since 1999. Transport, housing, and food were the expenditures contributing the most toward the total footprint. CF per unit of expenditure increased with overall expenditure levels (elasticity: 1.14), notably owing to the correlation between overall household expenditure and transport activities (elasticity: 1.48). Household energy use, which is generally inelastic, is, in Norway, largely based on hydropower and hence contributes comparatively little to the overall expenditure elasticity of household CF.},

  abstract = {Resident energy consumption can be divided into direct and indirect parts, and the indirect part is often considered to be much more important than direct part by some scholars. In this paper, on the basis of Consumer Lifestyle Approach (CLA) and the estimation of Net Primary Productivity (NPP), Energy Ecological Footprint (EEF) of indirect energy consumption is calculated using statistical data of Chinese urban and rural areas from 1999 to 2010. And then, improved STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology) model is used to empirically study the influences of urbanization level, economic level, Engel coefficient, energy intensity and industry structure on indirect energy consumption. Given the consideration of potential multicollinearity, the model is estimated using partial least square (PLS) regression. The results indicate that, for urban residents, the EEF of indirect energy use is on the rise. It is positively influenced by urbanization level, per capita income and the ratio of tertiary industry, but negatively influenced by Engel coefficient and energy intensity. For rural residents, the EEF is declining. It is positively influenced by Engel coefficient, energy intensity and tertiary industry proportion, while negatively influenced by urbanization level and per capita income. Combining these empirical findings and China's specific circumstances, some policy recommendations are made.},

  abstract = {Analysis of household consumption and its environmental impact remains one of the most important topics in sustainability research. Nevertheless, much past and recent work has focused on domestic national averages, neglecting both the growing importance of international trade on household carbon footprint and the variation between households of different income levels and demographics. Using consumer expenditure surveys and multi-country life cycle assessment techniques, this paper analyzes the global and distributional aspects of American household carbon footprint. We find that due to recently increased international trade, 30\% of total US household CO2 impact in 2004 occurred outside the US. Further, households vary considerably in their CO2 responsibilities: at least a factor of ten difference exists between low and high-impact households, with total household income and expenditure being the best predictors of both domestic and international portions of the total CO2 impact. The global location of emissions, which cannot be calculated using standard input--output analysis, and the variation of household impacts with income, have important ramifications for polices designed to lower consumer impacts on climate change, such as carbon taxes. The effectiveness and fairness of such policies hinges on a proper understanding of how income distributions, rebound effects, and international trade affect them.},

Depending on the definition and system boundary of the NEI, the mitigation options and priorities may vary. The territorial system boundary used by the UNFCCC has been critiqued for not including international transportation and potentially causing carbon leakage. To address these issues, past literature has argued in favour of using consumption-based NEI in climate policy. This article discusses several issues in moving from the standard production-based NEI to consumption-based NEI. First, two distinct accounting approaches for constructing consumption-based NEI are presented. The approaches differ in the allocation of intermediate consumption of imported products. Second, a consistent method of weighting production-based and consumption-based NEI is discussed. This is an extension of the previous literature on shared responsibility to NEI. Third, due to increased uncertainty and a wide system boundary it may be difficult to implement consumption-based NEI directly into climate policy. Several alternative options for incorporating consumption-based inventories into climate policy are discussed.},

An employment footprint includes a country's domestic employment and that occurring along the supply chains of, and hence embodied in, its imported goods and services. Our results allow us to group the world's nations into ``masters'' that enjoy a lifestyle supported by workers in other countries and ``servants'' that support the lifestyle of master countries. We show that, in 2010, employment footprints of countries differed substantially from their own workforce footprints. Hong Kong, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and Switzerland occupy the top-ranking positions of master countries, whereas many African and Asian countries are servants. Our findings show that the commodities that are ``servant intensive,'' such as electronics, agricultural products, and chemicals, tend to have complex supply chains often originating in third-world countries. The quantification of these master-servant relationships and the exposing of implicated supply chains could be of benefit to those concerned with their corporate social responsibility and committed to fairer trading or those developing policy around fair globalization.},

While the Multi Regional Input-Output analysis has been accepted by the scientific community as an alternative to the IPCC accounting, some concerns arise from the feasibility and the actual implementation of this methodology. In this paper, we apply a simplified framework recently introduced by Caro et al. (2014a), called NCI (National Carbon Intensity) method, and estimate the total CO2 emissions due to consumption in 175 countries during the period 2008e2012, with a focus on the Mediterranean area. We estimate CO2 emissions embodied in trade, assigning emission responsibility on the basis of each country's demand. Globally in 2012, 8129 Mt CO2 emissions were related to goods produced in one country and consumed outside its boundaries. A relevant example is the export from China to consumers located in the USA, Japan, and Germany. A focus on the Mediterranean area, that resulted as a net importer of CO2 embodied in traded goods, identifies the export of emissions from Italy and Spain to France and from Libya and Algeria to Italy as the dominant flows. The NCI method provides a realistic picture of emissions due to consumption that differs from high resolution Multi Regional Input-Output database by less than 10\%. The method can be largely adopted as a more feasible preliminary step towards consumption-based emission accounting and responsibility assignment.},

Interregional trade of total embodied energy uses approximately tripled between 2002 and 2007, and the total trade volumes in it were equivalent to 38.2\% of the national total direct primary energy input in 2002 and 62.9\% of that in 2007, respectively. Among all the eight regions, Northwest, Central, Northeast and Southwest were the interregional net exporters and deficit receivers of embodied energy in contrast to East Coast, South Coast, North Coast and Beijing--Tianjin as interregional net importers and surplus receivers. Significant growth of net embodied energy transfers can be identified from central and western inland regions to eastern coastal regions, and the Central region partly served as a ``transmission channel''. By considering the interregional embodied energy transfers, regional energy use inventories changed largely, and the spatial and temporal differences between 2002 and 2007 were expanding. Industrial positions in domestic and global supply chains and inherent economic driving factors such as increasing regional consumption level, accelerated investment in fixed assets and rapidly expanding export were the major driving forces for the embodied energy transfers among regions. To form a set of useful tool for controlling energy consumption and achieving the goals for energy saving and emission reduction, China's governors at all levels deserve to understand the relationships between energy producers and users from the view of demand-driven energy requirements.},

Different accounting principles exert a significant influence on China's regional carbon emissions, especially the fairness of carbon emission reduction targets, and the responsibility for reducing emissions.

The results show that the carbon emissions in each region and sector are different: from the eastern region to the western region they show a downward trend, and the embodied carbon flow accounts for a large proportion of the total. Secondary industries are a major contributor to carbon emissions and there is a signifiant influence exerted on the results of carbon emission accounting in various provinces of China under different accounting principles. Therefore, to meet national emission reduction targets, the provinces need to pay considerable attention to the choice of accounting principles and achieve the principle of fairness and impartiality. It will provide a reference for the future division of responsibility for carbon emissions in provinces of China.},

Much attention has been focused on the CO 2 directly emitted by each country, but relatively little attention has been paid to the amount of emissions associated with the consumption of goods and services in each country. Consumption-based accounting of CO 2 emissions differs from traditional, production-based inventories because of imports and exports of goods and services that, either directly or indirectly, involve CO 2 emissions. Here, using the latest available data, we present a global consumption-based CO 2 emissions inventory and calculations of associated consumption-based energy and carbon intensities. We find that, in 2004, 23\% of global CO 2 emissions, or 6.2 gigatonnes CO 2 , were traded internationally, primarily as exports from China and other emerging markets to consumers in developed countries. In some wealthy countries, including Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, the United Kingdom, and France, {$>$}30\% of consumption-based emissions were imported, with net imports to many Europeans of {$>$}4 tons CO 2 per person in 2004. Net import of emissions to the United States in the same year was somewhat less: 10.8\% of total consumption-based emissions and 2.4 tons CO 2 per person. In contrast, 22.5\% of the emissions produced in China in 2004 were exported, on net, to consumers elsewhere. Consumption-based accounting of CO 2 emissions demonstrates the potential for international carbon leakage. Sharing responsibility for emissions among producers and consumers could facilitate international agreement on global climate policy that is now hindered by concerns over the regional and historical inequity of emissions.},

To this end, we use a detailed Multi-Regional Input--Output database and three prevalent structural decomposition analysis methods. To reduce biases in the results due to time lapse and currency variations, we convert input--output tables to common US\$ and 1990-constant prices. This study provides a broad overview of the magnitude and distribution of the drivers for energy footprints across countries. The results of this study demonstrate that for almost all countries affluence and population growth are driving energy footprints worldwide, which is in part counteracted by the retarding effect of industrial energy intensity. In particular, this study demonstrates that with increasing per-capita GDP, the total energy footprint of a country is increasingly concentrated on imports or consumption.},

The analysis is based on a multi-regional input--output model, which allows us to estimate life-cycle emissions for all major household consumption items. Results demonstrate that household carbon footprints in all the Baltic States significantly increased by 47\% in Estonia, 20\% in Latvia and 52\% in Lithuania during the study period. In 2011 in Estonia expenditures for housing and utility contributed the highest per capita life-cycle emissions --43\%. However, in Lithuania housing accounted only for 16\% of per capita emissions, but food and transport were responsible for 31\%; whereas in Estonia and Latvia transport accounted for 18\% and 21\%, respectively. Production processes related to food consumption are responsible for 18\% of emissions in Estonia, 31\% in Latvia and Lithuania. Most of the indirect emissions are related to imports from Russia and China followed by imports from other Baltic States. If consumption-based emissions are to decrease countries will have to (1) change household behavior, which requires relevant knowledge, infrastructure and resources to facilitate switching to lower carbon-intensive alternatives; (2) decarbonize their own energy and transport sectors; and (3) reduce lifecycle emissions associated with trade, by supporting imports from low carbon regions, including producing locally.},

  abstract = {Cities are pivotal hubs of socioeconomic activities, and consumption in cities contributes to global environmental pressures. Compiling city-level multi-regional input-output (MRIO) tables is challenging due to the scarcity of city-level data. Here we propose an entropybased framework to construct city-level MRIO tables. We demonstrate the new construction method and present an analysis of the carbon footprint of cities in China's Hebei province. A sensitivity analysis is conducted by introducing a weight reflecting the heterogeneity between city and province data, as an important source of uncertainty is the degree to which cities and provinces have an identical ratio of intermediate demand to total demand. We compare consumption-based emissions generated from the new MRIO to results of the MRIO based on individual city input-output tables. The findings reveal a large discrepancy in consumption-based emissions between the two MRIO tables but this is due to conflicting benchmark data used in the two tables.},

Attribution of GHG emissions should be refined.

It also fails to capture the enormous disparities within and across cities as emissions are lowest for poor cities and particularly low for the urban poor.},

This study investigates the price responsiveness of households and various influencing factors through a pricing experiment which was imple\- mented as a reward scheme and involved 3746 Norwegian households. These households, characterised by a highly electrified energy usage such as electric heating and charging electric cars, were subjected to variable hourly price signals with a one-day advance notification over the course of three winter months. The study reveals that households reduced their electricity demand by, on average, 2.92\% in hours with high prices, and the reduction did not diminish significantly after repeated interventions. Moreover, an increased response could be observed for price signals with a short peak price period and when prices exceeded a threshold of 15 NOK/ kWh. These results suggest that despite the limited potential of manual demand response from households, it can still be relied upon and utilised to enhance power system operations and planning. Additionally, to fully exploit its potential, it is recommended to enhance price responsiveness through tailored price information and by incentivising investments in automatic response and energy storage.},

Poverty eradication requires improvement in the living conditions of low-income households, which leads in turn to higher carbon footprints and may undermine the efforts of climate change mitigation. Previous studies have assessed the climate impacts of poverty eradication, but few have quantified how the additional carbon emissions of poverty eradication are shared at the subnational level in China and the impact on China's climate targets. We investigated the recent trend of carbon footprint inequality in China's provinces and estimated the climate burden of different poverty reduction schemes, measured by increased carbon emissions. The results indicate that poverty eradication will not impede the achievement of national climate targets, with an average annual household carbon footprint increase of 0.1\%--1.2\%. However, the carbon emissions growth in less developed provinces can be 4.0\%, five times that in wealthy regions. Less developed regions suffer a greater climate burden because of poverty eradication, which may offset carbon reduction efforts. Therefore, interregional collaboration is needed to coordinate inequality reduction with investments in low-carbon trajectories in all provinces.},

  abstract = {Abstract Growing consumption is both necessary to end extreme poverty 1 and one of the main drivers of greenhouse gas emissions 2 , creating a potential tension between alleviating poverty and limiting global warming. Most poverty reduction has historically occurred because of economic growth 3--6 , which means that reducing poverty entails increasing not only the consumption of people living in poverty but also the consumption of people with a higher income. Here we estimate the emissions associated with the economic growth needed to alleviate extreme poverty using the international poverty line of US \$2.15 per day (ref.\, 7 ). Even with historical energy- and carbon-intensity patterns, the global emissions increase associated with alleviating extreme poverty is modest, at 2.37 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year or 4.9\% of 2019 global emissions. Lower inequality, higher energy efficiency and decarbonization of energy can ease this tension further: assuming the best historical performance, the emissions for poverty alleviation in 2050 will be reduced by 90\%. More ambitious poverty lines require more economic growth in more countries, which leads to notably higher emissions. The challenge to align the development and climate objectives of the world is not in reconciling extreme poverty alleviation with climate objectives but in providing sustainable middle-income standards of living.},

While the Multi Regional Input-Output analysis has been accepted by the scientific community as an alternative to the IPCC accounting, some concerns arise from the feasibility and the actual implementation of this methodology. In this paper, we apply a simplified framework recently introduced by Caro et al. (2014a), called NCI (National Carbon Intensity) method, and estimate the total CO2 emissions due to consumption in 175 countries during the period 2008e2012, with a focus on the Mediterranean area. We estimate CO2 emissions embodied in trade, assigning emission responsibility on the basis of each country's demand. Globally in 2012, 8129 Mt CO2 emissions were related to goods produced in one country and consumed outside its boundaries. A relevant example is the export from China to consumers located in the USA, Japan, and Germany. A focus on the Mediterranean area, that resulted as a net importer of CO2 embodied in traded goods, identifies the export of emissions from Italy and Spain to France and from Libya and Algeria to Italy as the dominant flows. The NCI method provides a realistic picture of emissions due to consumption that differs from high resolution Multi Regional Input-Output database by less than 10\%. The method can be largely adopted as a more feasible preliminary step towards consumption-based emission accounting and responsibility assignment.},

In the context of operationalizing value chain assessment within SDGs, the analysis combines social indicators with production, trade and consumption data, allowing the evaluation of the social footprint of European food production and consumption. Selected social indicators and impact subcategories from those available in the Product Social Impact Life Cycle Assessment (PSILCA) database were employed to assess a process-based Life Cycle Inventory model of EU food consumption by means of 44 representative products selected for the EU Consumption Footprint indicators. The assessment included an evaluation of SDGs coverage by S-LCA indicators and a sensitivity analysis based on two different weighting schemes, which unveiled the need of a harmonized weighting approach. Unlike the environmental impacts, social hotspots emerge mainly in rice and fruit \& vegetables categories. Hotspots are concentrated in India, Argentina, and other extra EU countries. These results suggest that trade-offs could emerge between the different sustainability pillars and that fair trade and responsible sourcing approaches should be guaranteed in order to promote sustainable food systems. {\copyright} 2022 The Author(s).

Among the multiple factors that explain the HCF, some previous research has confirmed the relevance of gender. In this paper, we calculate the HCF of individual Spanish households using an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output model (EEMRIO) that quantifies the emissions embedded in the supply chain of goods and services that households consume. We assess the differences in consumption and emissions patterns, measuring the gender effect by a new variable, the female share of the household. This represents a remarkable improvement over previous literature that used simpler approaches. Moreover, we assess the partial effect of gender on HCF using multivariate regressions for total and sectoral emissions. Our results show that households with a majority of men have a higher HCF and carbon intensity. Even when controlling for economic, sociodemographic, and regional factors there are differences in the sectoral emissions according to gender. Female households spend more (and generate more emissions) on housing and food products, while male households show that pattern for restaurants and transport. These results can help orientate environmental campaigns and demand-side mitigation policies.},

  abstract = {Inequality has recently become a major concern in economics. Leaving aside its social and economic effects is also possible to trace its environmental consequences, which this article attempts to assess. The indicator to be measured is the household's carbon footprint (CF) for different social groups. The deep economic crisis in the Spanish economy between 2008 and 2013 has increased consumption inequality and doubled the number of households below the poverty line. When focusing on domestic consumption, we found that the shopping basket of all income groups has very similar emissions intensities; therefore, the differences among the household CFs depend mainly on the scale effect (i.e., the size of consumption). However, when international trade is also considered, we found that the emission intensity of imports is bigger than the intensity of all the respective domestic goods. Therefore, the share of imported goods and services by social class will be an important determinant of the respective total CF. Before the crisis, households with higher incomes imported 30\% of their total consumption items whereas households with lower income imported only 20\% of their consumption. During the crisis, the imports of medium-highincome households fell to 20\%, whereas low- and middle-income families maintained the same import share, which contributed to the reduction of the total household CF.},

Here, we explore household-level consumption data to illustrate the distribution of carbon footprints and consumption within 26 European Union countries, regions and social groups. The analysis further sheds light on the relationships between carbon footprints and socially desirable outcomes such as income, equality, education, nutrition, sanitation, employment and adequate living conditions. , Technical summary We need a good understanding of household carbon distributions in order to design equitable carbon policy. In this work, we analyse household-level consumer expenditure from 26 European Union (EU) countries and link it with greenhouse gas (GHG) intensities from the multiregional input--output database EXIOBASE. We show carbon footprint distributions and elasticities by country, region and socio-economic group in the context of per capita climate targets. The top 10\% of the population with the highest carbon footprints per capita account for 27\% of the EU carbon footprint, a higher contribution to that of the bottom 50\% of the population. The top 1\% of EU households have a carbon footprint of 55 tCO 2 eq/cap. The most significant contribution is from air and land transport, with 41\% and 21\% among the top 1\% of EU households. Air transport has a rising elasticity coefficient across EU expenditure quintiles, making it the most elastic, unequal and carbon-intensive consumption category in this study. Only 5\% of EU households live within climate targets, with carbon footprints below 2.5 tCO 2 eq/cap. Our analysis points to the possibility of mitigating climate change while achieving various well-being outcomes. Further attention is needed to limit trade-offs between climate change mitigation and socially desirable outcomes. , Social media summary EU top 1\% of households emit 22 times the per capita climate targets.

Results show that, on a per capita basis, inhabitants of medium-large municipalities emit fewer carbon emissions than those settled in small ones (between 0.34 and 0.54 tCO2/cap depending on the year studied). This carbon unbalance is mainly explained by the higher direct carbon footprints of dwellers who reside in small municipalities and, in special, in rural zones. Furthermore, applying inequality measures through a consumption-based carbon footprint Gini coefficient, we show that both income and CO2 emissions inequality are lower in small municipalities. In the light of the findings, in Spain, the application of a carbon pricing on direct and indirect carbon footprints will be regressive, disproportionally affecting people of small municipalities and rural areas. Accordingly, household carbon inequalities must be contemplated to avoid poorly designed climate change mitigation policies.},

In this article, we address the carbon emission responsibility of the city of Bogota from a consumption-based perspective, by assessing the carbon footprint for the whole city. We use an environmentally extended multiregional input-output model where a survey-based input-output table of Bogota is nested, avoiding the downside of using assumptions regarding the production and trade structure of the city. We identify city's emissions hotspots across the globe, mainly in China and the United States, proving that consumption-based accounting is required when highly open systems as cities are under analysis, to finally propose source shifting scenarios as mitigation strategies. Our results indicate that Bogota is a net importer of CO2 emissions and, the city's carbon footprint almost double direct emissions generated within its territory. China, the rest of Colombia, and the United States are heavily affected by Bogota's carbon footprint as those three regions bear 38\% of the city's footprint. The main drivers of those emissions are Electrical equipment, Computers, Vehicles and Machinery, goods that are imported and consumed by Bogota's residents. Important opportunities for emission reductions arise when sourcing changes from China to the US and Latin American countries, which provide fresh evidence for national and local authorities to improve their efforts on reducing emissions.},

This notwithstanding, the critique of (and alternative to) Solow's proposal advanced by Pasinetti (1959) has not been equally acknowledged. The debate re-emerged when a posthumous note by Richard Stone (1998[1960]) triggered a further exchange between the authors. This paper aims at retracing the key conceptual aspects of the discussion, pointing to some limitations of Pasinetti's original implementation of his measure of productivity changes, and providing an Input--Output generalisation based on Pasinetti's notion of hyper-integrated labour. Seen in this light, Pasinetti's computable measure of technical change provides a theoretically sound alternative to perform productivity analyses from a Classical perspective.},

Results show that the carbon footprint of tourism in Spain fell by 63\% in 2020 compared to pre-pandemic levels, which would be aligned with the current sectoral decarbonisation target. However, the new tourists' consumption patterns resulting from the pandemic are insufficient to increase tourism sustainability if they imply pre-pandemic consumption levels.

The urbanization process is one of the salient characteristics of the current stage of globalization, so it is imperative to know more about their global economic, social and environmental impacts. MRIO initiatives are defined at the country level, which means that we are potentially losing some key information about cities and their economic structures. In this paper, we fill this gap by putting together the IOT for the city of Bogota (Colombia) into the wellknown OECD's ICIO database. After describing the structure of both IOTs, we document the harmonization and nesting procedures in a step by step approach, focusing on the main challenges and assumptions that we have to make. Additionally, a case study has been carried out to weight the level of integration of Bogota in global value chains. The analysis proves the low level of global integration: the bulk of the valued-added gener-ated in Bogota due to the city's exports comes from the economy of the rest of the country and presents a significant deficit in its value-added balance. Apart, we hope it could shed some light to conduct similar adaptations for other cities.},

We employ a Multi-Regional Input-Output model and an own elaboration database of social impacts concerning undignified working conditions. Results indicate that most countries achieved the goal of decoupling occupational injuries -both fatal and non-fatal- from production, while results for forced labour show a slower and sometimes uncertain process of decoupling.

  abstract = {Abstract Achieving sustainability within planetary boundaries requires radical changes to production and consumption beyond technology- and efficiency-oriented solutions, especially in affluent countries. The literature on degrowth offers visions and policy paths with the explicit aim of ensuring human wellbeing within an economy with a lower resource metabolism. This paper reviews and discusses the academic literature on degrowth with the aim of deriving the main inherent challenges where further research is needed. Proponents of degrowth envisage radical redistribution and decommodification with `floors' and `ceilings' for income and wealth, as well as extensive public service provision. This paper outlines how results from other research support such a policy direction. However, the paper discusses three inherent challenges for such a future with respect to the feasibility and desirability of degrowth policies, as well as their legitimate underpinning in public support. This includes the internal growth dependencies of established social policies, which require changes to financing, output-based management and perhaps even curtailing input (service demand). Secondly, it concerns the role of public welfare provision when degrowth advocates also envisage the proliferation of alternative and informal economies. The paper emphasises that these two challenges invite more work on where public service provision should play a lesser role. Thirdly, the paper covers popular legitimacy. In affluent democracies, popular support needs to expand further beyond the `new left' or the `green left', even if larger shares of the population exhibit some potential for growth-critical stances. At the heart of these challenges is the need for new norms and values with respect to wellbeing, which is envisaged in the literature as a shift from materialist and hedonic towards needs-oriented and eudaimonic conceptions of wellbeing and happiness.},

Food contributes towards almost a third of the region's EF, and appropriates over half of its biocapacity. Average reliance on biocapacity within national borders decreased, while reliance on intra-EU biocapacity increased; yet a quarter of the biocapacity for food consumption originates from non-EU countries. Despite a reduction in both total EF and food EF over the study period, EU-27 residents demand more from nature than the region's ecosystems can regenerate---highlighting the need for new or strengthened food and trade policies to enable a transformation to sustainable EU food systems.},

Nevertheless, much past and recent work has focused on domestic national averages, neglecting both the growing importance of international trade on household carbon footprint and the variation between households of different income levels and demographics. Using consumer expenditure surveys and multi-country life cycle assessment techniques, this paper analyzes the global and distributional aspects of American household carbon footprint.

Further, households vary considerably in their CO2 responsibilities: at least a factor of ten difference exists between low and high-impact households, with total household income and expenditure being the best predictors of both domestic and international portions of the total CO2 impact. The global location of emissions, which cannot be calculated using standard input--output analysis, and the variation of household impacts with income, have important ramifications for polices designed to lower consumer impacts on climate change, such as carbon taxes. The effectiveness and fairness of such policies hinges on a proper understanding of how income distributions, rebound effects, and international trade affect them.},

  abstract = {Designing mitigation policies for households requires knowledge of household carbon distributions. This study surveys the household carbon inequality in urban China and analyzes its sources and determinants using weighted household survey data. Different from existing literatures studying carbon inequality on the international or regional level, we focus on the household aspect and first survey its characteristics by some comparisons. By ascribing household carbon emissions calculated by the Consumer Lifestyle Approach to several consumption categories with the method of Gini coefficient decomposition, we find that residential consumption with high carbon intensity is the most important source of household carbon inequality in urban China. Food consumption and the consumption of educational, cultural and recreational services are the next largest sources because of the consumed quantities or carbon intensity. The application of Shapley decomposition shows the determinants of household carbon inequality in urban China and their contributions, which are household demographic characteristics (59.74\%), household employment and income (24.31\%), household burdens (8.00\%), and household assets and financial plans (7.95\%). The policy implications of these results are also discussed.},

In this paper, on the basis of Consumer Lifestyle Approach (CLA) and the estimation of Net Primary Productivity (NPP), Energy Ecological Footprint (EEF) of indirect energy consumption is calculated using statistical data of Chinese urban and rural areas from 1999 to 2010. And then, improved STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology) model is used to empirically study the influences of urbanization level, economic level, Engel coefficient, energy intensity and industry structure on indirect energy consumption. Given the consideration of potential multicollinearity, the model is estimated using partial least square (PLS) regression. The results indicate that, for urban residents, the EEF of indirect energy use is on the rise. It is positively influenced by urbanization level, per capita income and the ratio of tertiary industry, but negatively influenced by Engel coefficient and energy intensity. For rural residents, the EEF is declining. It is positively influenced by Engel coefficient, energy intensity and tertiary industry proportion, while negatively influenced by urbanization level and per capita income. Combining these empirical findings and China's specific circumstances, some policy recommendations are made.},

The unique data set allows us to estimate direct GHG emissions with an unprecedented level of specificity based on household energy use survey data and geographic positioning system--verified personal travel data. Of the variables analyzed, household size, income, community zone, age, and marital status are all statistically significant predictors of direct GHG emissions. Birthplace, ethnicity, educational attainment, perceptions of health, life satisfaction, job satisfaction, happiness, volunteering, or community belonging did not seem to matter. In addition, we examined whether those reporting energy-efficient behaviors had lower GHG emissions. No significant differences were discovered among the groups analyzed, supporting a growing body of research indicating a disconnect between environmental attitudes and behaviors and environmental impact. Among the predictor variables, those reporting to be married, young, low income, and living in households with more people have correspondingly lower direct GHG emissions than other categories in respective groupings. Our finding that respondents with lifestyles that generate higher GHG emissions did not report to be healthier, happier, or more connected to their communities suggest that individuals can experience similar degrees of well-being regardless of the amount of GHG emissions associated with his or her respective lifestyle.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a study of the evolution of Spanish households' material footprint for the period 2006 to 2013. The method proposed combines the multiregional input-output model with Spanish national data on household consumption according to social group. Material footprint has been affected by the 2008 economic crisis. In relative terms, the share of Spanish households' material footprint, with respect to total material footprint, decreased drastically from 70.7\% in 2006 to 50.8\% in 2011. This reduction can be mainly attributed to the construction sector crash (34.4\% of the reduction is due to construction materials), followed by biomass (29\%), metals (27.1\%) and fossil fuels (26.1\%). By type of household, the material footprint exhibits a scale effect while consumption and income levels grow; and this is accompanied by a global teleconnection effect, which varies from 62\% for biomass, to 64\% for metals, to 82\% for construction materials, to 95\% for fossil fuels. Given the context of increasing income inequality, we perform one redistribution simulation from high to middle- and low-income households, finding a material footprint increase in all cases. The most materialized consumer basket is that corresponding to households with incomes between 1500 and 1999 euros. Above that income level, the growing weight of expenditures on services reduces the use of materials. Importantly, social (income redistribution) and environmental (material footprint) sustainability will become incompatible if responsibility is transferred only to households.},

Using the new EXIOBASE 2.2 multiregional input-output database, which describes the world economy at the detail of 43 countries, five rest-of-the-world regions, and 200 product sectors, we are able to trace the origin of the products consumed by households and represent global supply chains for 2007. We highlight the importance of environmental pressure arising from households with their consumption contributing to more than 60\% of global GHG emissions and between 50\% and 80\% of total land, material, and water use. The footprints are unevenly distributed across regions, with wealthier countries generating the most significant impacts per capita. Elasticities suggest a robust and significant relationship between households' expenditure and their environmental impacts, driven by a rising demand of nonprimary consumption items. Mobility, shelter, and food are the most important consumption categories across the environmental footprints. Globally, food accounts for 48\% and 70\% of household impacts on land and water resources, respectively, with consumption of meat, dairy, and processed food rising fast with income. Shelter and mobility stand out with high carbon and material intensity, whereas the significance of services for footprints relates to the large amount of household expenditure associated with them.},

Import embodied footprints (IEFs) vary significantly depending on the country of origin, and therefore can be reduced through source shifting. We explore the impacts of shifting imports to the countries with lowest impact intensities per M{\texteuro} according to four environmental pressures (carbon emissions, materials, water, and land), using Environmentally Extended Multi Regional Input-Output (EEMRIO) analysis. There are significant limitations of EEMRIO analysis (the price and product mix homogeneity assumptions), which we discuss in the paper. We find that a limited set of 13 products, among which food products and chemicals which are not elsewhere classified (n.e.c.), is responsible for more than half of all impacts embodied in imports for each pressure. Except for a few product groups, optimizing sourcing as to minimize impact for one pressure reduces impact in all others. The pressure exhibiting the highest scope for optimization is water. Carbon and material use optimization yields the largest reduction in other environmental pressures. We discuss increasing the policy relevance of EEMRIO in the case of IEFs by disaggregating n.e.c. product groups, and incorporating dynamic effects.},

In this paper we consider how this drift toward more and smaller households, occurring alongside rising affluence, undermines efforts to curb carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by eroding household scale economies of consumption and associated CO2 emissions. To estimate the household scaling of CO2 emissions, we link consumer expenditure data to an economic input--output life-cycle assessment model. We find that the CO2 scaling benefits of cohabitation are compellingly large, with the carbon footprint of a representative person cohabiting with others being 23\% less, on average, than if that same person lived alone. Additionally, we find that household scale economies: 1) decrease in income, reflecting the rise in the percentage of household expenditures devoted to more rival goods and services; and 2) increase intuitively in household size, reflecting the direct expenditure sharing benefits of cohabitation. The combined downward pressure on scale economies from declining household size and rising incomes, typifying the trajectory of developing societies toward more and smaller households and rising affluence, places significant upward pressure on CO2 emissions globally.},

A wide range of studies and approaches for CBCF have been presented, yet a systematic and interpretative synopsis of the literature is missing. We present a comprehensive review of more than 100 CBCF studies published in Scopusindexed journals until 2019. We analyze the methodological and conceptual development of spatially related CBCFs and provide guidance for future research. While the recent emergence of several global multi-region input-output (MRIO) models has meant remarkable development in assessment accuracy, there is space for improvement in hybrid-modeling and increasing sectoral detail. Furthermore, it was recognized that studies published under the same CBCF label actually fall into two categories with different definitions and potentially significantly different outcomes. We suggest labeling these as Areal CF (ACF) and Personal CF (PCF) in the future. ACF encompasses the CBCF of economic activities within selected geographic boundaries, and the global production and delivery chain emissions of the goods and services consumed therein, including those consumed by visitors. PCF covers the consumption of the residents of the area regardless of where the consumption takes place but excludes the consumption of visitors within the area in question. ACF analyses typically include government consumption and investments, whereas PCF analyses normally exclude these. This scope issue is seldom brought up in individual studies, and it currently takes a lot of effort and expertise to classify existing studies, which hinders their usability for policy-making. In addition, we suggest that future studies position themselves among previous studies on the same location, discuss potential reasons for differences in the results, and consider these when drawing policy conclusions.},

To achieve efficiency and justice in emissions reduction, policymakers need to fully understand the sources of HCFs and identify the major causes of carbon inequality. By applying the Unconditional Quantile Regression (UQR) model and decomposition method to the Chinese household survey data, this paper investigates the distributional features of HCFs and their de\- terminants. We find that HCFs are unevenly distributed due to differences in the volume and pattern of con\- sumption, which are further determined by household characteristics and lifestyles. The intertemporal lifestyle changes have played a major role in the rise of HCFs inequality measured by various quantile emissions dif\- ferentials. In addition, considerable increases in HCFs come from the high carbon emission groups, and most of the HCFs inequality stems from the 90--50 emissions differential. To transform the current carbon-intensive economy, policies are required to enhance environmental equity and encourage low-carbon lifestyles.},

  abstract = {Abstract Numerous studies have investigated the hotspots for reducing carbon emissions associated with household consumption, including reducing household carbon footprints (CFs) and greener lifestyle choices, such as living car-free, eating less meat, and having one less child. However, estimating the effect of each of these actions requires the simultaneous consideration of lifestyle choices and household characteristics that could also affect the household CF. Here, we quantify the reduction in household CFs for 25 factors associated with individual lifestyle choices or socioeconomic characteristics. This study linked approximately 42 000 microdata on consumption expenditure with the Japanese subnational 47 prefecture-level multi-regional input--output table, which are both the finest-scale data currently available. We improved the accuracy of household CF calculations by considering regional heterogeneity, and successfully estimated the magnitude of household CF reduction associated with individual lifestyle choices and socioeconomics. For example, it was found that moving from a cold region to a region with mild climate would have considerable potential for reducing the CO 2 emissions of a household, all other factors being equal. In addition, a household residing in a house that meets the most recent energy standards emits 1150 kg less CO 2 per year than if they reside in a house that meets previous energy standards. Ownership and use of durable goods also had the potential for reducing the CO 2 emissions of a household; a normal-sized car, a personal computer, a compact car, and a bidet were associated with CO 2 emissions of 922, 712, 421, and 345 kg per year, respectively. The findings therefore have important implications for climate change mitigation and policy measures associated with lifestyle.},

  abstract = {The growing awareness of the current and future consequences of climate change has led to a range of inter\- national commitments aimed at ensuring sustainable development as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the Paris Agreement. These agreements reflect a concern of how to reduce carbon emissions and the pathway towards environmental improvement. Recent literature has pointed out the role of households as direct and indirect drivers of environmental impacts and as key agents in achieving lowcarbon economies and climate-resilient development. Disparities in income distribution and lifestyles within and among countries, however, entail a different starting point for each country to reach sustainable pathways. The EU is fully committed to delivering on the United Nations 2030 Agenda and its implementation. Inequality continues to be a significant concern, reflected in the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. In this context, we explore the relationships between household consumption patterns in the EU, income inequality, and global carbon emissions trends, using an environmentally extended multiregional and multisectoral input-output model. We study the trends in global carbon emissions associated with the different household consumption patterns and income categories over 15 years, and evaluate the role of income distribution, consumption pat\- terns, and technological conditions by country and income group. Additionally, we study, through certain sce\- narios, the potential achievement of double dividends, by alleviating poverty and reducing emissions.},

  abstract = {CO 2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are the primary cause of global warming. Much attention has been focused on the CO 2 directly emitted by each country, but relatively little attention has been paid to the amount of emissions associated with the consumption of goods and services in each country. Consumption-based accounting of CO 2 emissions differs from traditional, production-based inventories because of imports and exports of goods and services that, either directly or indirectly, involve CO 2 emissions. Here, using the latest available data, we present a global consumption-based CO 2 emissions inventory and calculations of associated consumption-based energy and carbon intensities. We find that, in 2004, 23\% of global CO 2 emissions, or 6.2 gigatonnes CO 2 , were traded internationally, primarily as exports from China and other emerging markets to consumers in developed countries. In some wealthy countries, including Switzerland, Sweden, Austria, the United Kingdom, and France, {$>$}30\% of consumption-based emissions were imported, with net imports to many Europeans of {$>$}4 tons CO 2 per person in 2004. Net import of emissions to the United States in the same year was somewhat less: 10.8\% of total consumption-based emissions and 2.4 tons CO 2 per person. In contrast, 22.5\% of the emissions produced in China in 2004 were exported, on net, to consumers elsewhere. Consumption-based accounting of CO 2 emissions demonstrates the potential for international carbon leakage. Sharing responsibility for emissions among producers and consumers could facilitate international agreement on global climate policy that is now hindered by concerns over the regional and historical inequity of emissions.},

Here we analyse consumption-based emission accounts (for the main greenhouse gases (GHGs)) for the EU, focusing on understanding sectoral contributions and what changes have been observed over the last two decades, including the role of trade. The EU28 has reduced its overall GHG footprint by 8\% over the two decades, mainly due to the use of more efficient technology, both at home and abroad. Emissions embodied in imports, which make up one-third of the EU28 GHG footprint, grew strongly until 2008 but have stabilized in volume since. Foreign production has been more emissions intensive than if goods were produced in the EU. However, the overall contribution of this effect is small, offset by much larger (global) technological improvements and growths in consumption. Hence the focus should now be on accounting and responsibility for enacting change, not the global impact of trade. Finally, the inclusion of non-CO2 GHGs in the analysis shows their importance in the traded element, particularly for the mining and agricultural sectors.},

  abstract = {A growing body of literature discusses the CO2 emissions of cities. Still, little is known about emission patterns across density gradients from remote rural places to highly urbanized areas, the drivers behind those emission patterns and the global emissions triggered by consumption in human settlements---referred to here as the carbon footprint. In this letter we use a hybrid method for estimating the carbon footprints of cities and other human settlements in the UK explicitly linking global supply chains to local consumption activities and associated lifestyles. This analysis comprises all areas in the UK, whether rural or urban. We compare our consumption-based results with extended territorial CO2 emission estimates and analyse the driving forces that determine the carbon footprint of human settlements in the UK. Our results show that 90\% of the human settlements in the UK are net importers of CO2 emissions. Consumption-based CO2 emissions are much more homogeneous than extended territorial emissions. Both the highest and lowest carbon footprints can be found in urban areas, but the carbon footprint is consistently higher relative to extended territorial CO2 emissions in urban as opposed to rural settlement types. The impact of high or low density living remains limited; instead, carbon footprints can be comparatively high or low across density gradients depending on the location-specific socio-demographic, infrastructural and geographic characteristics of the area under consideration. We show that the carbon footprint of cities and other human settlements in the UK is mainly determined by socio-economic rather than geographic and infrastructural drivers at the spatial aggregation of our analysis. It increases with growing income, education and car ownership as well as decreasing household size. Income is not more important than most other socio-economic determinants of the carbon footprint. Possibly, the relationship between lifestyles and infrastructure only impacts carbon footprints significantly at higher spatial granularity.},

Nevertheless, much past and recent work has focused on domestic national averages, neglecting both the growing importance of international trade on household carbon footprint and the variation between households of different income levels and demographics. Using consumer expenditure surveys and multi-country life cycle assessment techniques, this paper analyzes the global and distributional aspects of American household carbon footprint. We find that due to recently increased international trade, 30\% of total US household CO2 impact in 2004 occurred outside the US. Further, households vary considerably in their CO2 responsibilities: at least a factor of ten difference exists between low and high-impact households, with total household income and expenditure being the best predictors of both domestic and international portions of the total CO2 impact. The global location of emissions, which cannot be calculated using standard input--output analysis, and the variation of household impacts with income, have important ramifications for polices designed to lower consumer impacts on climate change, such as carbon taxes. The effectiveness and fairness of such policies hinges on a proper understanding of how income distributions, rebound effects, and international trade affect them.},

Marketing experts have long recognized the usefulness of developing composite variables to target specific consumer lifestyles and have subsequently developed market segmentation approaches to express relationships between geodemographics and consumer behavior. This paper represents the first use of detailed segmentation data to look at US footprint at high spatial resolution. We employ market segmentation data to delineate lifestyles for approximately 70 000 census tracts in the US and develop a spatial framework to better conceptualize lifestyles as location specific typologies of emission drivers. We find that lifestyles are not only very useful in explaining variations in emissions but in fact are as important as income, typically recognized as the major determinant of consumption emissions. Results from our analysis link the differences between suburban and urban footprints directly to lifestyle patterns and illustrate the geographic distribution of emissions resulting from households' consumption. We find that statistical clustering and consumer classification methods provide a unique perspective for understanding how various CO2 drivers interact and impact household emissions. Our proposed framework suggests that carbon mitigation strategies should move beyond a `one-size-fits-all' approach centered on income and account for community specific lifestyle impacts related to consumer preferences and demographic characteristics at fine spatial scale.},

We show that they can reach several hundred tons of CO2 per year, while the majority of people living below poverty lines have yearly carbon footprints of less than 1\,tCO2. Reaching targets under United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 1, lifting more than one billion people out of poverty, leads to only small relative increases in global carbon emissions of 1.6--2.1\% or less. Nevertheless, carbon emissions in low- and lower-middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa can more than double as an effect of poverty alleviation. To ensure global progress on poverty alleviation without overshooting climate targets, high-emitting countries need to reduce their emissions substantially.},

Here, we develop an approach to interpret carbon footprints of cities by focusing on their system boundaries, double counting recognition, spatial paths and policy sensitivities. Using four megacities in China as a case study, we quantify and map urban carbon footprints from various accounting perspectives: territorial carbon emissions, community-wide infrastructure carbon footprint, consumption-based carbon footprint, wider production carbon footprint, and full-scope carbon footprint. We find that the megacities' infrastructure carbon footprints are dominated by electricity-related emissions, whereas their consumption-based carbon footprints are significantly impacted by imports of both electricity and other products and services. Over 55\% of the full-scope carbon footprints (sums of all three scopes) of Beijing and Shanghai can be attributed to upstream emissions, while in Chongqing and Tianjin territorial emissions are more important. Key urban infrastructure contributes over 70\% to the total carbon emissions in import supply chains, determining the spatial paths and the carbon intensities of imports for these megacities. The main destinations of outsourced carbon emissions across the country from the megacities are found to be similar due to market domination of bulk suppliers of infrastructure-related and other carbon-intensive products. In addition, double counting of certain footprint indicators is considered small in this case, but could be amplified with increasing number of cities being assessed.},

In this context, an important but underexplored issue concerns the relationship between the scale of urban areas and their carbon emissions. This paper employs the urban Kaya relation and Reduced Major Axis regression to look at urban emission patterns in China from 2000 to 2016. Our results reveal that larger cities tend to have lower per capita emissions. Thus, population agglomeration may be able to contribute to climate change mitigation and a wider transition to sustainability. The inverse-U shape between carbon emissions and population size is found. In addition, we observe unique scaling patterns in different regions, revealing how the relationship between emissions and population can be influenced by economic geography. City consumption weakens the role of population agglomeration in reducing carbon emissions in the East region, therefore it should be placed top priority in carbon emissions mitigation. These findings are important for China which looks to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 against the backdrop of intertwined interplay between population agglomeration and city consumption.},

However, as cities get bigger, denser and more resource-efficient, they also get richer, and richer inhabitants consume more, potentially increasing resource demand and associated environmental impacts. In this paper, we propose a method based on scaling theory to assess Brand's Law taking into account greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from both direct (energy and fuels locally consumed) and indirect (embedded in goods and services) sources, measured as carbon footprint (CF). We aim at understanding whether Brand's Law can be confirmed once we adopt a consumption-based approach to urban emissions. By analyzing the balance between direct and indirect emissions in a theoretical urban system, we develop a scaling theory relating carbon footprint and city size. Facing the lack of empirical data on consumption-based emissions for cities, we developed a model to derive emission estimations using well-established urban metrics (city size, density, infrastructure, wealth). Our results show that, once consumption-based CF is considered, Brand's Law falls apart, as bigger cities have greater purchase power, leading to greater consumption of goods and higher associated GHG. Findings also suggest that a shift in consumption patterns is of utmost importance, given that, according to the model, each new monetary unit added to the gross domestic product (GDP) or to other income variables results in a more than proportional increase in GHG emissions. This work contributes to a broader assessment of the causes of emissions and the paradigm shift regarding the assumption of efficiency in the relationship of city size and emissions, adding consumption behavior as a critical variable, beyond Brand's Law.},

This special volume (SV) provides a platform that promotes multi- and inter- disciplinary analyses and discussions on the climate change mitigation for cities. All papers are divided into four themes, including GHG emission inventory and accounting, climate change and urban sectors, climate change and sustainable development, and strategies and mitigation action plans. First, this SV provides methods for constructing emission inventory from both production and consumption perspectives. These methods are useful to improve the comprehensiveness and accuracy of carbon accounting for international cities. Second, the climate change affects urban sectors from various aspects; simultaneously, GHG emissions caused by activities in urban sectors affect the climate system. This SV focuses on mitigation policies and assessment of energy, transport, construction, and service sectors. Third, climate change mitigation of cities is closely connected to urban sustainable development. This SV explores the relationships between climate change mitigation with urbanization, ecosystems, air pollution, and extreme events. Fourth, climate change mitigation policies can be divided into two categories: quantity-based mechanism (e.g., carbon emission trading) and price-based mechanism (e.g., carbon tax). This SV provides experiences of local climate change mitigation all over the world and proposes the city-to-city cooperation on climate change mitigation.},

We employ a bottom-up approach combining two unprecedented microscopic data on population and carbon dioxide emissions in the continental US. We first aggregate settlements that are close to each other into cities using the City Clustering Algorithm (CCA) defining cities beyond the administrative boundaries. Then, we use data on CO2 emissions at a fine geographic scale to determine the total emissions of each city. We find a superlinear scaling behavior, expressed by a power-law, between CO2 emissions and city population with average allometric exponent {$\beta$} = 1.46 across all cities in the US. This result suggests that the high productivity of large cities is done at the expense of a proportionally larger amount of emissions compared to small cities. Furthermore, our results are substantially different from those obtained by the standard administrative definition of cities, i.e. Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Specifically, MSAs display isometric scaling emissions and we argue that this discrepancy is due to the overestimation of MSA areas. The results suggest that allometric studies based on administrative boundaries to define cities may suffer from endogeneity bias.},

In an empirical analysis for The Netherlands between 1986 and 1992, results are calculated for 24 equivalent decomposition forms. The outcomes exhibit a large degree of variability across the different forms. We also examine the two approaches that have been used predominantly in the literature. The average of the two so-called polar decompositions appears to be remarkably close to the average of the full set of 24 decompositions. The approximate decomposition with mid-point weights appears to be almost exact.

  abstract = {This article explores the causes for differences in the average CO2 emissions intensity of the new passenger car (NPC) fleet in member states (MS) across Europe. Although EU policies mitigating CO2 emissions from NPCs have been in place since 1999, MS strongly diverge in the absolute amount and relative change in emissions over the last decade. The authors employ a qualitative approach to analyse the factors, in particular national vehicle taxes, contributing to this divergence and the relative contribution of national and European policies in reducing national CO2 emissions from NPCs. The analysis shows that there has been a significant reduction in CO2 emissions intensity of NPCs since 2007 across most MS, compared with the six years previous to that date. This would indicate that EU-wide policies, such as the CO2 vehicles regulation, along with the economic recession in 2008, have influenced national NPC CO2 emissions. Generally, countries with CO2-differentiated vehicle taxes are observed as more likely to have achieved greater reductions in CO2 emissions. However, over the same period there have been many confounding factors, such as economic instability in the EU, that also influence NPC emissions. Using more detailed case study analyses of six countries, the authors find that there is scope for well-designed national vehicle tax policies to drive NPC emissions down further than the EU average. In countries with the highest success rate, such as the Netherlands, the design of the vehicle tax, as part of a well-aligned policy package, has been very important in delivering the biggest reductions in CO2 emissions from NPCs. POLICY RELEVANCE The transport sector continues to be an intractable source of CO2 emissions. Governments around the world are seeking effective policies to deal with the increase in passenger car CO2 emissions appropriate to their own circumstances. This article examines the experience of EU MS with CO2-differentiated vehicle taxes in reducing CO2 emissions in the context of other national and international contributing factors. It should therefore both be useful to policy makers and contribute to climate policy research in general.},

These agreements reflect a concern of how to reduce carbon emissions and the pathway towards environmental improvement. Recent literature has pointed out the role of households as direct and indirect drivers of environmental impacts and as key agents in achieving low-carbon economies and climate-resilient development. Disparities in income distribution and lifestyles within and among countries, however, entail a different starting point for each country to reach sustainable pathways. The EU is fully committed to delivering on the United Nations 2030 Agenda and its implementation. Inequality continues to be a significant concern, reflected in the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. In this context, we explore the relationships between household consumption patterns in the EU, income inequality, and global carbon emissions trends, using an environmentally extended multiregional and multisectoral input-output model. We study the trends in global carbon emissions associated with the different household consumption patterns and income categories over 15 years, and evaluate the role of income distribution, consumption patterns, and technological conditions by country and income group. Additionally, we study, through certain scenarios, the potential achievement of double dividends, by alleviating poverty and reducing emissions.},

However, the factors driving the decline have not been quantitatively evaluated; the role of natural gas in the decline therefore remains speculative. Here we analyse the factors affecting US emissions from 1997 to 2013. Before 2007, rising emissions were primarily driven by economic growth. After 2007, decreasing emissions were largely a result of economic recession with changes in fuel mix (for example, substitution of natural gas for coal) playing a comparatively minor role. Energy--climate policies may, therefore, be necessary to lock-in the recent emissions reductions and drive further decarbonization of the energy system as the US economy recovers and grows.},

Therefore, their consumption behavior is of interest in evaluations of climate policy options and projections of future emission paths. While most evaluations of household consumption and its emissions are based on expenditure only, we use a household consumption model based on functional units (e.g., kg food, person kilometers, living square meters). The goal of this article is to assess changes in consumption with increasing affluence level of households and to compare the allocation of GHG emissions to monetary versus functional units. We find that (1) the model based on functional units provides good bottom-up estimates for greenhouse emissions of Swiss households; (2) quality (price per functional unit) increases with income for many consumption categories, and therefore using functional instead of monetary units leads to a lower increase of greenhouse gas emissions with income; (3) the relevance of GHG emissions from goods and mobility will increase. We conclude that using household models based on monetary units only overestimates the impact of marginal consumption and neglects the potential of decoupling income and environmental impact by consuming better instead of more. For sustainable consumption, research and policy should aim at preventing goods of higher quality from having higher environmental impact in order to benefit from the increasing quality orientation with rising income.},

Rich households generate more emissions per capita than poor households via both their direct energy consumption and their higher expenditure on goods and services that use energy as an intermediate input. An econometric analysis confirms a positive relationship between emissions and income and establishes a slightly increasing marginal propensity to emit (MPE) over the relevant income range. The redistribution of income from rich to poor households is therefore shown to reduce aggregate household emissions, suggesting that the twin pursuits of reducing inequality and emissions can be achieved in tandem.},

  abstract = {An extensive body of literature demonstrates how higher density leads to more efficient energy use and lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport and housing. However, our current understanding seems to be limited on the relationships between the urban form and the GHG emissions, namely how the urban form affects the lifestyles and thus the GHGs on a much wider scale than traditionally assumed. The urban form affects housing types, commuting distances, availability of different goods and services, social contacts and emulation, and the alternatives for pastimes, meaning that lifestyles are actually situated instead of personal projects. As almost all consumption, be it services or products, involves GHG emissions, looking at the emissions from transport and housing may not be sufficient to define whether one form would be more desirable than another. In the paper we analyze the urban form--lifestyle relationships in Finland together with the resulting GHG implications, employing both monetary expenditure and time use data to portray lifestyles in different basic urban forms: metropolitan, urban, semi-urban and rural. The GHG implications are assessed with a life cycle assessment (LCA) method that takes into account the GHG emissions embedded in different goods and services. The paper depicts that, while the direct emissions from transportation and housing energy slightly decrease with higher density, the reductions can be easily overridden by sources of indirect emissions. We also highlight that the indirect emissions actually seem to have strong structural determinants, often undermined in studies concerning sustainable urban forms. Further, we introduce a concept of `parallel consumption' to explain how the lifestyles especially in more urbanized areas lead to multiplication of consumption outside of the limits of time budget and the living environment. This is also part I of a two-stage study. In part II we will depict how various other contextual and socioeconomic variables are actually also very important to take into account, and how diverse GHG mitigation strategies would be needed for different types of area in different locations towards a low-carbon future.},

A wide range of studies and approaches for CBCF have been presented, yet a systematic and interpretative synopsis of the literature is missing. We present a comprehensive review of more than 100 CBCF studies published in Scopus-indexed journals until 2019. We analyze the methodological and conceptual development of spatially related CBCFs and provide guidance for future research. While the recent emergence of several global multi-region input-output (MRIO) models has meant remarkable development in assessment accuracy, there is space for improvement in hybrid-modeling and increasing sectoral detail. Furthermore, it was recognized that studies published under the same CBCF label actually fall into two categories with different definitions and potentially significantly different outcomes. We suggest labeling these as Areal CF (ACF) and Personal CF (PCF) in the future. ACF encompasses the CBCF of economic activities within selected geographic boundaries, and the global production and delivery chain emissions of the goods and services consumed therein, including those consumed by visitors. PCF covers the consumption of the residents of the area regardless of where the consumption takes place but excludes the consumption of visitors within the area in question. ACF analyses typically include government consumption and investments, whereas PCF analyses normally exclude these. This scope issue is seldom brought up in individual studies, and it currently takes a lot of effort and expertise to classify existing studies, which hinders their usability for policy-making.

  abstract = {The effect of changes in trade patterns, particularly increasing international sourcing, on global CO2-emissions growth has yet to be clearly understood. In this paper, we estimate the emission cost of sourcing (ECS), which originates from replacing domestic products by imports from countries with more CO2-intensive technologies. Using a structural decomposition analysis, we find that changes in sourcing patterns between 1995 and 2007 contribute (1) to reducing territorial emissions in high-wage countries (70\% of their territorial emissions growth) and (2) to increasing territorial emissions in low-wage countries (30\% of their territorial emissions increase). The net global effect, the ECS, amounts to 18\% of total global CO2-emissions growth. Our results call the climate change policies based on territorial principles into question given that they disregard that differences in emission intensities between countries contribute to raising global emissions. In contrast, policies fostering the transfer of cleaner technologies to low-wage countries decrease the ECS.},

Using national household surveys, we developed econometric models of demand for energy, transportation, food, goods, and services that were used to derive average household carbon footprints (HCF) for U.S. zip codes, cities, counties, and metropolitan areas. We find consistently lower HCF in urban core cities ({$\sim$}40 tCO2e) and higher carbon footprints in outlying suburbs ({$\sim$}50 tCO2e), with a range from {$\sim$}25 to {$>$}80 tCO2e in the 50 largest metropolitan areas. Population density exhibits a weak but positive correlation with HCF until a density threshold is met, after which range, mean, and standard deviation of HCF decline. While population density contributes to relatively low HCF in the central cities of large metropolitan areas, the more extensive suburbanization in these regions contributes to an overall net increase in HCF compared to smaller metropolitan areas. Suburbs alone account for {$\sim$}50\% of total U.S. HCF. Differences in the size, composition, and location of household carbon footprints suggest the need for tailoring of greenhouse gas mitigation efforts to different populations.},

To support well-informed mitigation efforts, administrators need robust inventories of both direct emissions as well as the supply chain emissions. Here we construct household CF inventories for 1172 Japanese cities using detailed consumer expenditure data and a Japanese domestic multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model. We identify the consumption activities which city policymakers can target to reduce CF. We observe a strong concentration of household CF in a few cities in Japan: 40\% of the total Japanese CF is driven by 143 cities.

The carbon footprint (CF) is a practical measure to identify the responsibility of individuals, cities, or nations in climate change. Numerous CF studies have focused on national accounts, and a few combined consumer consumption and global supply chains to estimate additionally detailed spatial CF. However, the drivers of temporal change in detailed spatial CF are largely unknown, along with regional, spatial, and socioeconomic disparities. Here, we uncovered the drivers of changes in household CFs in EU regions, at the finest scale currently available, between 2010 and 2015. This study mapped the household CFs of 83 macro-regions across 27 EU nations and identified the driving factors underlying their temporal change. We combined multi-regional input-output tables and micro-consumption data from 275 247 and 272 045 households in 2010 and 2015, respectively. We decomposed EU regional CF, employing structural decomposition analysis, into five driving factors: emission intensity, supply chain structure, population, per capita consumption, and final demand share. For a deeper assessment of changes in the contribution of consumption patterns, we further categorized the regional CF into 15 factors, including 11 per capita consumption categories. We found that household CF drivers vary depending on region, population density, income, and consumption patterns. Our results can help policymakers adopt climate policies at the regional level by reflecting on the residents' socioeconomic, spatial, and consumption conditions, for further ambitious climate actions.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have investigated the hotspots for reducing carbon emissions associated with household consumption, including reducing household carbon footprints (CFs) and greener lifestyle choices, such as living car-free, eating less meat, and having one less child. However, estimating the effect of each of these actions requires the simultaneous consideration of lifestyle choices and household characteristics that could also affect the household CF. Here, we quantify the reduction in household CFs for 25 factors associated with individual lifestyle choices or socioeconomic characteristics. This study linked approximately 42 000 microdata on consumption expenditure with the Japanese subnational 47 prefecture-level multi-regional input--output table, which are both the finest-scale data currently available. We improved the accuracy of household CF calculations by considering regional heterogeneity, and successfully estimated the magnitude of household CF reduction associated with individual lifestyle choices and socioeconomics. For example, it was found that moving from a cold region to a region with mild climate would have considerable potential for reducing the CO2 emissions of a household, all other factors being equal. In addition, a household residing in a house that meets the most recent energy standards emits 1150 kg less CO2 per year than if they reside in a house that meets previous energy standards. Ownership and use of durable goods also had the potential for reducing the CO2 emissions of a household; a normal-sized car, a personal computer, a compact car, and a bidet were associated with CO2 emissions of 922, 712, 421, and 345 kg per year, respectively. The findings therefore have important implications for climate change mitigation and policy measures associated with lifestyle.},

In this topical review, we synthesise the literature to explain recent trends in global and regional emissions in each of these sectors. To contextualise our review, we present estimates of GHG emissions trends by sector from 1990 to 2018, describing the major sources of emissions growth, stability and decline across ten global regions. Overall, the literature and data emphasise that progress towards reducing GHG emissions has been limited. The prominent global pattern is a continuation of underlying drivers with few signs of emerging limits to demand, nor of a deep shift towards the delivery of low and zero carbon services across sectors. We observe a moderate decarbonisation of energy systems in Europe and North America, driven by fuel switching and the increasing penetration of renewables. By contrast, in rapidly industrialising regions, fossil-based energy systems have continuously expanded, only very recently slowing down in their growth. Strong demand for materials, floor area, energy services and travel have driven emissions growth in the industry, buildings and transport sectors, particularly in Eastern Asia, Southern Asia and South-East Asia. An expansion of agriculture into carbon-dense tropical forest areas has driven recent increases in AFOLU emissions in Latin America, South-East Asia and Africa. Identifying, understanding, and tackling the most persistent and climate-damaging trends across sectors is a fundamental concern for research and policy as humanity treads deeper into the Anthropocene.},

To this end, we use a detailed Multi-Regional Input--Output database and three prevalent structural decomposition analysis methods. To reduce biases in the results due to time lapse and currency variations, we convert input--output tables to common US\$ and 1990-constant prices. This study provides a broad overview of the magnitude and distribution of the drivers for energy footprints across countries. The results of this study demonstrate that for almost all countries affluence and population growth are driving energy footprints worldwide, which is in part counteracted by the retarding effect of industrial energy intensity. In particular, this study demonstrates that with increasing per-capita GDP, the total energy footprint of a country is increasingly concentrated on imports or consumption.},

In contrast to conventional emissions accounting which captures only territorial or local production activities, the CF includes the emissions imposed by consumption across global supply chains for goods and services. Recent interest has grown in the application of CF assessment for municipalities owing to their large contribution to global carbon emissions and the limited coverage of existing data to monitor their climate pledges. By linking household-level consumer surveys to a global supply chain database, spatially-explicit CF assessment is possible at a district and household scale. To date, such technique has exposed otherwise unforeseen differences in consumer carbon footprints in developed countries. Within this study we calculate and compare the household carbon footprints 623 districts in India, based on micro consumption data from 203,313 households and explain their variation by economic, cultural and demographic factors. We show the eradication of extreme poverty does not conflict with ambitious climate change mitigation in India. However, our analysis suggests CF reduction policies within India need to target high-expenditure households which are responsible for nearly seven times the carbon emissions than low-expenditure households (living on \$1.9 consumption a day). These vast disparities between the carbon footprint of citizens in India highlights the need to differentiate individual responsibilities for climate change in national and global climate policy.},

  abstract = {Background: Current climate change mitigation policies, including the Paris Agreement, are based on territorial greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting. This neglects the understanding of GHG emissions embodied in trade. As a solution, consumption-based accounting (CBA) that reveals the lifecycle emissions, including transboundary flows, is gaining support as a complementary information tool. CBA is particularly relevant in cities that tend to outsource a large part of their production-based emissions to their hinterlands. While CBA has so far been used relatively little in practical policymaking, it has been used widely by scientists. Methods and design: The purpose of this systematic review, which covers more than 100 studies, is to reflect the policy implications of consumption-based carbon footprint (CBCF) studies at different spatial scales. The review was conducted by reading through the discussion sections of the reviewed studies and systematically collecting the given policy suggestions for different spatial scales. We used both numerical and qualitative methods to organize and interpret the findings of the review. Review results and discussion: The motivation for the review was to investigate whether the unique consumption perspective of CBA leads to similarly unique policy features. We found that various carbon pricing policies are the most widely supported policy instrument in the relevant literature. However, overall, there is a shortage of discussion on policy instruments, since the policy discussions focus on policy outcomes, such as behavioral change or technological solutions. In addition, some policy recommendations are conflicting. Particularly, urban density and compact city policies are supported by some studies and questioned by others. To clarify the issue, we examined how the results regarding the relationship between urban development and the CBCF vary. The review provides a concise starting point for policymakers and future research by summarizing the timely policy implications.},

In addition to making the strategies, it is important to follow, how they work in practice. The aim of the study is to examine, how climate change mitigation policies and other events affected the consumption-based household carbon footprints in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA) from 2006 until 2012. The cities of the HMA launched an ambitious climate change mitigation strategy in 2007. Furthermore, the study analyses the changes in the carbon footprints of six different types of urban zone within the HMA: the central pedestrian zone, the fringe of the central pedestrian zone, intensive public transport zone, public transport zone, car zone and the pedestrian zones of subcentres. The results of the study reveal that the average carbon footprint decreased 7\% from 2006 to 2012, despite 1\% increase in expenditure, which is encouraging. Emissions caused by housing energy consumption and motor fuel consumption decreased the most. Among the urban zones, public transport zone and car zone, which are the two outermost zones of the HMA, had the strongest emission reductions. Cleaner electricity and the improved energy efficiency of buildings had a strong effect. The regression analysis of the study suggests that the central pedestrian zone and the car zone, the two most affluent zones of the HMA, have higher carbon footprints than all the other zones have between them. However, this is only true when income is controlled, not when expenditure is controlled. The economic crisis in 2008, and changes in consumption behaviour because of it, seem to explain the result. The reduction of the average carbon footprint in the HMA was not only due to steered mitigation actions. Increased housing costs seem to have contributed to the decline of consumption-based emissions. The results of the study suggest that to achieve the ambitious international, national and local climate change mitigation targets, stronger measures are needed.},

Footprints are derived using input-output analysis, while environmental issue preferences and potential remedial actions are identified using a national survey. To highlight the value of the broadly applicable framework, here we demonstrate a case study of Japan, which is interesting due to shifting demographics engendering an aging, shrinking population. Key findings include that the mitigation of environmental footprints in line with household preferences can positively influence both societal equity outcomes and contribute to closing the gap between rich and poor. Importantly, broad participation, i.e. participation irrespective of income level, is shown to be more effective than participation from a single sector. These findings can assist policymakers to develop policies which are responsive to societal preferences and demographic trends while also furthering the debate toward clarifying norms for acceptable levels of social equity.},

The authors have developed a cloud-computing platform called the Japan Industrial Ecology Laboratory (IELab) that is highly flexible in terms of its sectoral and regional resolution, which enables the user to build customized Japanese MRIO tables in accordance with the user's specific objectives. The Japan IELab embeds over 145 types of statistical information on regional economic activities, including input-output tables at the prefecture and city level. These data serve as constraints in the optimization process to build a customized MRIO table. With IELab, the user can freely select cities, sectors and years from 1894 municipalities and 4266 sectors for the years 2005 through 2016. As a case study, two MRIO tables were built at the prefecture and city levels to demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of the system. Their validity was confirmed by comparing results with the original statistics. The prefecture-level MRIO table accurately reflected the economic structure of Japan's 47 prefectures by identifying differentiating prefectural features, distinguishing between, for example, manufacturing-oriented and service-oriented prefectures. The city-level MRIO table appropriately characterized various economic activities and accurately reflected the locational features of a city within the prefecture. The role of stakeholders in data management and further improvement as well as possible applications of the Japan IELab, including life cycle assessment and disaster analysis, are discussed.},

We use structural decomposition analysis (SDA) with chained constant price input--output tables and environmental extensions. We construct three sets of constant-price data using a smoothing algorithm to remove random variations from the data, and find that the results of the SDA are relatively robust to these variations. The production of exports was responsible for around 70\% of the growth in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 to 2002, household consumption of domestically produced products for about 15\%, government 10\%, with the remainder due to gross capital formation. The dominance of exports in the emissions growth may make future greenhouse gas mitigation challenging in Norway, particularly considering that the exports are dominated by oil and gas production.},

  abstract = {Cities are hotspots of socio-economic activities and greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of this study was to extend the research range of the urban carbon footprint (CF) to cover emissions embodied in products traded among regions and intra-city sectors. Using Xiamen City as a study case, the total urban-related emissions were evaluated, and the carbon flows among regions and intra-city sectors were tracked. Then five urban CF accountings were evaluated, including purely geographic accounting (PGA), community-wide infrastructure footprint (CIF), and consumption-based footprint (CBF) methods, as well as the newly defined production-based footprint (PBF) and purely production footprint (PPF). Research results show that the total urban-related emissions of Xiamen City in 2010 were 55.2 Mt CO2e/y, of which total carbon flow among regions or intra-city sectors accounted for 53.7 Mt CO2e/y. Within the total carbon flow, import and export respectively accounted for 59 and 65\%, highlighting the importance of emissions embodied in trade. By regional trade balance, North America and Europe were the largest net carbon exported-to regions, and Mainland China and Taiwan the largest net carbon imported-from regions. Among intra-sector carbon flows, manufacturing was the largest emission-consuming sector of the total urban carbon flow, accounting for 77.4, and 98\% of carbon export was through industrial products trade. By the PBF, PPF, CIF, PGA and CBF methods, the urban CFs were respectively 53.7 Mt CO2e/y, 44.8 Mt CO2e/y, 28.4 Mt CO2e/y, 23.7 Mt CO2e/y, and 19.0 Mt CO2e/y, so all of the other four CFs were higher than the CBF. All of these results indicate that urban carbon mitigation must consider the supply chain management of imported goods, the production efficiency within the city, the consumption patterns of urban consumers, and the responsibility of the ultimate consumers outside the city.},

  abstract = {All cities present environmental sustainability issues, above all regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and specifically carbon dioxide (CO2), that directly affect climate change. Consequently, it is very important to quantify and report their Carbon Footprint (CF) for implementing national and international policies/strategies aimed at mitigating and adapting these concerns. The Urban Carbon Footprint (UCF), indeed, has been recognized as the more valuable choice to inform, specifically, decision makers about city environmental sustainability. Several accounting systems and inventory methods have been taken into account to perform UCF, highlighting the complexity of the topic and generating very often confusion among users. In this context, the authors aim to summarize what has been done and what is going on with UCFs, trying to classify them according to some principal dimensions. Thus, they divide UFCs in two main categories namely: ``spatial'' or ``direct'', with a limited amount of data requested, and ``economic'' or ``life cycle based'', more or less data inclusive according to the accounting systems considered. Furthermore, they observe that there is not a ``global agreed-upon protocol'' yet, neither is there a specific model shared among researchers, even if some steps have been made towards this direction (Relative Carbon Footprint - RCF, Publicly Available Specification -- PAS 2070 and Global Protocol for Community scale - GPC). Consequently, it is necessary to complete and standardize, in the short term, the accounting and reporting frameworks, in order to compare different UCFs for adopting shared climate strategies and actions at global level.},

The objective of this study is to analyze the relationships between the emissions caused by countries from a demand point of view, the carbon footprints and the demand for goods and services in these countries, and especially in the European countries. With this aim, a two-step process was carried out. Firstly, carbon footprints were calculated during the 1995--2009 period. Secondly, the EKC hypothesis between these carbon footprints and the total final demands were tested by using panel data and a multilevel mixed-effects model. The results show that the EKC hypothesis is not supported when considering carbon footprints with respect to final demand. It is also shown that carbon footprints are slightly increasing with respect to final demand beyond proportionality. The carbon footprint elasticities are different between countries, their values increasing with the final demand per capita of countries.},

  abstract = {In the framework of pressing local and global environmental challenges it is essential to understand that cities are complex systems dependent on and linked to the rest of the world through global supply chains that embody an array of environmental flows. Cities are thus a complex articulation that intertwine local and global challenges which rely at their extended hinterland for their resource use and pollution emission. To assess the environmental sustainability of an urban area in a comprehensive manner, it is not only necessary to measure its local and direct environmental performance but also to understand and take into account its global and indirect environmental counterparts. This paper presents a comparative analysis of a territorial-based and a consumption-based approach to estimate both direct and embodied resource use and pollution flows for the case of Brussels Capital Region (Belgium). The territorial-based approach is based on local energy, water and material consumption measured data as well as measured data on waste generation and pollution emissions. The estimation of indirect resource use and pollution emissions (or consumption-based approach) is based on the regional IO-tables of the city-region of Brussels extended with multi-region input-output tables, taking into account the global flows of consumption. The comparison of these two approaches is particularly relevant in the case of cities that have limited productive activities and limited or no extraction of materials as the impact on the hinterland is often underestimated or neglected by local (environmental) policies which are only based on territorial-based figures. The results show that the indirect primary energy use, GHG emissions and material use estimated by the consumption-based approach is more than three times higher than local measures indicate. The embodied water use, estimated via IOA, was over 40 times higher than the local water consumption. These results show that territorial-based approach using local data underestimate the resource needs and pollution emissions of a city and can therefore be insufficient or even be misguiding. By mapping the origin of embodied flows it is in fact possible to illustrate the open character of an urban economy and its dependence on the global hinterland. Finally, this paper discusses the possibility and relevance to combine these two approaches to create a hybrid framework that measures the full environmental performance of cities both accurately and comprehensively.},

  abstract = {In 2008, the European Commission (EC) launched the Covenant of Mayors (CoM), a voluntary agreement under which local governments commit to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 20\% within 2020, in order to reinforce local authorities in designing strategies to mitigate climate change in coherence with the European Union's climate policy. The CoM may be defined as a coordinated collection of experiments based on common rules established by the EC. Cities signing the CoM commit to follow guidelines and standardized methodologies in setting CO2 emission reduction targets and in designing and implementing policies and measures to reach them, through the definition of key tools such as the Baseline Emission Inventory (BEI) and the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP). The present study analyses the emission reduction strategies of a sample of 124 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, signatories of the CoM, which delivered a SEAP by February 2014. More than 5500 actions planned by the sample cities were analysed and categorized. The most relevant actions in terms of recurrence and mitigation impact were assessed. Finally a set of variables was tested through a regression so as to determine their influence on emission reductions strategies. The main results of this study show that the sample cities accounted for a total of 370 million tons of CO2 emissions in selected baseline years and 94 million tons of intended emission reductions per year. The total emission reductions planned by cities reached 25\% of the baseline emissions. Buildings and Transport stood out as the sectors where cities intend to deliver the largest emission reductions. Furthermore the analysis showed that cities' administrations attribute higher potential to actions in subsectors under their direct control (municipal buildings, public transport, municipal fleet and public lighting) compared to actions in subsectors managed by private actors (households and firms). In the Building sector, the category of action delivering the highest share of CO2 emission reductions was represented by integrated actions, which combine several types of intervention so as to maximise the energy efficiency of buildings. In the transport sector, it was the modal shift, which implies a transition from private transport to public and cleaner transport modes. In both the Building and Transport sectors, cities plan to reduce the major amount of CO2 emissions through the implementation of management and organization, infrastructure construction and awareness-raising policy levers. Our results may be useful to urban policy makers to shape their mitigation strategies in coherence with cities' commitments and plans and to replicate policies and actions on the basis of CoM signatories' experiences.},

Cities usually source a major part of their natural resource demand from their local, national and global hinterland, and cause emissions across the whole global supply chain of a city's final demand. It is important that the data underlying carbon footprint assessments of cities capture these supply chains adequately and comprehensively. In this research, we determine the carbon footprints of four Chinese cities, Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Tianjin based on different levels of data availability. Using these case studies, we show conclusively that city carbon footprint analyses must include input-output databases and associated calculus in order to avoid severe errors that arise from unacceptable scope limitations caused by the truncation of the footprint assessment boundary. We also show that city input-output databases must fulfil a number of requirements for city comparisons and for informed decision-making to be feasible. Our findings suggest that investment into multi-layered national input-output tables and datasets will be necessary to monitor progress of cities reducing their greenhouse emissions across the whole supply chain and to inform evidence based policy making that guides greenhouse abatement.},

This fact is also partly reflected in two United Nations (UN) processes: on the one hand, the Paris Agreement of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change under which countries agreed to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2 {$^\circ$}C above pre-industrial levels and, on the other hand, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals aiming to end poverty. These agreements are seen as important foundation to put the world nations on a sustainable pathway. However, how these agreements can be achieved or whether they are even mutually compatible is less clear. We explore the global carbon inequality between and within countries and the carbon implications of poverty alleviation by combining detailed consumer expenditure surveys for different income categories for a wide range of countries with an environmentally extended multi-regional input--output approach to estimate carbon footprints of different household groups, globally, and assess the carbon implications of moving the poorest people out of poverty. Given the current context, increasing income leads to increasing carbon footprints and makes global targets for mitigating greenhouse gases more difficult to achieve given the pace of technological progress and current levels of fossil fuel dependence. We conclude that the huge level of carbon inequality requires a critical discussion of undifferentiated income growth. Current carbon-intensive lifestyles and consumption patterns need to enter the climate discourse to a larger extent.},

By combining a 2007 Norwegian consumer expenditure survey with emission coefficients from an environmental input-output model, reflecting emissions embodied in both domestically produced and imported goods and services, we calculate the per capita carbon footprint. The results from the analysis suggest that the per capita carbon footprint is directly proportional to expenditure with an estimated elasticity close to unity, implying no decoupling. The finding is partly driven by a near zero-emission power sector, which leads to comparatively low emissions embodied in domestically-produced goods and services.},

In this case study, we show that the applicability of the Ecological Footprint, an overarching outcome measure of resource consumption, for targeting climate change mitigation in cities. We focus on the carbon Footprint subcomponent of the Ecological Footprint, and further translate and disaggregate the carbon Footprint into detailed classification of individual consumption according to purpose (COICOP) and analyze the Footprint of consumption associated with each of these categories for 15 Canadian cities according to census metropolitan area (CMA), from each province. The Ecological Footprint of CMAs was calculated from the consumption land use matrix (CLUM) of Canada, by scaling results according to the annual national survey of household spending from 2010 to 2015. The expenditure in electricity was also scaled with the carbon intensity factor. Our findings indicate that the carbon Footprint remains the largest contributor of the Ecological Footprint of CMAs. The carbon Footprint associated with housing varied significantly with the source of electricity production. CMAs relying on renewable energy sources have a substantially lower carbon Footprint than those relying on fossil fuel energy. The carbon Footprint associated with the operation of personal transportation was the second largest among all consumption categories. Financial services is the largest share of the carbon Footprint from service consumption. Clothing consumption caused most of the goods' carbon Footprint. A better understanding of urban planning of Canadian CMAs and promoting local consumption will improve carbon mitigation and long-term sustainability.},

  abstract = {Background. Around two-thirds of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tCO2eq/cap. The average per capita carbon footprint of North America and Europe amount to 13.4 and 7.5 tCO2eq/cap, respectively, while that of Africa and the Middle East---to 1.7 tCO2eq/cap on average. Changes in consumption patterns to low-carbon alternatives therefore present a great and urgently required potential for emission reductions. In this paper, we synthesize emission mitigation potentials across the consumption domains of food, housing, transport and other consumption. Methods. We systematically screened 6990 records in the Web of Science Core Collections and Scopus. Searches were restricted to (1) reviews of lifecycle assessment studies and (2) multiregional input-output studies of household consumption, published after 2011 in English. We selected against pre-determined eligibility criteria and quantitatively synthesized findings from 53 studies in a meta-review. We identified 771 original options, which we summarized and presented in 61 consumption options with a positive mitigation potential. We used a fixed-effects model to explore the role of contextual factors (geographical, technical and socio-demographic factors) for the outcome variable (mitigation potential per capita) within consumption options. Results and discussion. We establish consumption options with a high mitigation potential measured in tons of CO2eq/capita/yr. For transport, the options with the highest mitigation potential include living car-free, shifting to a battery electric vehicle, and reducing flying by a long return flight with a median reduction potential of more than 1.7 tCO2eq/cap. In the context of food, the highest carbon savings come from dietary changes, particularly an adoption of vegan diet with an average and median mitigation potential of 0.9 and 0.8 tCO2eq/cap, respectively. Shifting to renewable electricity and refurbishment and renovation are the options with the highest mitigation potential in the housing domain, with medians at 1.6 and 0.9 tCO2eq/cap, respectively. We find that the top ten consumption options together yield an average mitigation potential of 9.2 tCO2eq/cap, indicating substantial contributions towards achieving the 1.5 {$^\circ$}C--2 {$^\circ$}C target, particularly in high-income context.},

The available urban infrastructure, services and societal arrangements, for example on work, all influence how households use their time, which goods and services they consume in everyday life and their subsequent carbon footprints and potential rebound effects.

  abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are simultaneously exhausting the world's supply of fossil fuels and threatening the global climate. In many developing countries, significant improvement in living standards in recent years due to the accelerating development of their economies has resulted in a disproportionate increase in household energy consumption. Therefore, a major reduction in household carbon emissions (HCEs) is essential if global carbon reduction targets are to be met. To do this, major Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) states have already implemented policies to alleviate the negative environmental effects of household behaviors and less carbon-intensive technologies are also proposed to promote energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. However, before any further remedial actions can be contemplated, though, it is important to fully understand the actual causes of such large HCEs and help researchers both gain deep insights into the development of the research domain and identify valuable research topics for future study. This paper reviews existing literature focusing on the domain of HCEs. This critical review provides a systematic understanding of current work in the field, describing the factors influencing HCEs under the themes of household income, household size, age, education level, location, gender and rebound effects. The main quantification methodologies of input--output models, life cycle assessment and emission coefficient methods are also presented, and the proposed measures to mitigate HCEs at the policy, technology and consumer levels. Finally, the limitations of work done to date and further research directions are identified for the benefit of future studies.},

However, many solutions to climate change mitigation misalign with such analytical frameworks. Here, we examine demand-side solutions, a crucial class of mitigation options that go beyond technological specification and cost-benefit analysis. To do so, we synthesize demand-side mitigation options in the urban, building, transport, and agricultural sectors. We also highlight the specific nature of demand-side solutions in the context of development. We then discuss key analytical considerations to integrate demand-side options into overarching assessments on mitigation. Such a framework would include infrastructure solutions that interact with endogenous preference formation. Both hard infrastructures, such as the built environment, and soft infrastructures, such as habits and norms, shape behavior and as a consequence offer significant potential for reducing overall energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude that systemic infrastructural and behavioral change will likely be a necessary component of a transition to a low-carbon society.},

Consumption is also at the heart of many of our most critical ecological, health, and social problems. What is referred to broadly as sustainable consumption has primarily focused on making consumption more efficient and gradually decoupling it from energy and resource use. We argue for the need to focus sustainable consumption initiatives on the key impact areas of consumption---transport, housing, energy use, and food---and at deeper levels of system change. To meet the scale of the sustainability challenges we face, interventions and policies must move from relative decoupling via technological improvements, to strategies to change the behavior of individual consumers, to broader initiatives to change systems of production and consumption. We seek to connect these emerging literatures on behavior change, structural interventions, and sustainability transitions to arrive at integrated frameworks for learning, iteration, and scaling of sustainability innovations. We sketch the outlines of research and practice that offer potentials for system changes for truly sustainable consumption.},

We find that in 2012 the urban very rich, comprising 5\% of population, induced 19\% of the total carbon footprint from household consumption in China, with 6.4 tCO2/cap. The average Chinese household footprint remains comparatively low (1.7 tCO2/cap), while those of the rural population and urban poor, comprising 58\% of population, are 0.5--1.6 tCO2/cap. Between 2007 and 2012 the total footprint from households increased by 19\%, with 75\% of the increase due to growing consumption of the urban middle class and the rich. This suggests that a transformation of Chinese lifestyles away from the current trajectory of carbon-intensive consumption patterns requires policy interventions to improve living standards and encourage sustainable consumption.},

Poverty eradication is also the first of the Sustainable Development Goals. This paper investigates potential consequences for climate targets of achieving poverty eradication. We find that eradicating extreme poverty, i.e., moving people to an income above \$1.9 purchasing power parity (PPP) a day, does not jeopardize the climate target even in the absence of climate policies and with current technologies. On the other hand, bringing everybody to a still modest expenditure level of at least \$2.97 PPP would have long-term consequences on achieving emission targets. Compared to the reference mitigation pathway, eradicating extreme poverty increases the effort by 2.8\% whereas bringing everybody to at least \$2.97 PPP would increase the required mitigation rate by 27\%. Given that the top 10\% global income earners are responsible for 36\% of the current carbon footprint of households; the discourse should address income distribution and the carbon intensity of lifestyles.},

Drawing on multi-sited ethnographic research and policy analysis in Sweden and China, we argue that while the logical implications of consumption-based analyses point to the need to address production and consumption as an integrated system, complex governance challenges and the political precariousness of these ideas have thus far limited policy to the reinvention of consumer awareness campaigns and an international extension of long-standing ecological efficiency efforts. We argue that consumption-based emissions indicators justify more ambitious demand-side policy response.},

Is there any validity to the claims that energy efficiency improvements can actually lead to an increase in energy use (known as backfire)? This article clarifies what the rebound effect is and provides a guide for economists and policymakers interested in its existence and magnitude. We discuss how some studies in the literature consider a rebound effect that results from a costless exogenous increase in energy efficiency, whereas others examine the effects of a specific energy efficiency policy---a distinction that leads to very different welfare and policy implications. We present the most reliable evidence available about the size of the energy efficiency rebound effect and discuss situations where such estimation is extraordinarily difficult. With this in mind, we present a new way of thinking about the macroeconomic rebound effect. We conclude that overall, the existing research provides little support for the so-called backfire hypothesis. However, our understanding of the macroeconomic rebound effect remains limited, particularly as it relates to induced innovation and productivity growth. (JEL: H23, Q38, Q41)},

  abstract = {Drawing from papers in this special volume (SV), this introductory paper on absolute reductions argues that the magnitude, scope and urgency of the sustainability challenge require a drastic change in global civilisation, including a radical transformation of the institutional arrangements and socio-technical systems that facilitate the pursuit of wellbeing. The authors of this paper identify four main challenges to absolute reductions, including: the resource-intensive conventional template for development, macroeconomic structures and trade policies creating burden-shifting and inequality, a resource-efficiency improvements fallacy, and the dominant consumerist culture and lifestyles. The paper demonstrates the complexity of translating planetary boundaries into boundaries for resource use and targets for absolute reductions, proposing a practical approach starting with defining footprints for water, land and materials, and then proceeding to set resource boundaries. In seeking potential solutions, the paper highlights research addressing materials and product substitution, ecological fiscal reform with measures such as carbon taxation, sustainable lifestyles, design for sustainability, eco-innovation, and management of power dynamics in the production-consumption system. We then propose six domains in a research agenda for future research. These include: moving from niches and demonstration projects to broader norms; addressing reductions targets and indicators to guide policy and action; including policy design reflecting complexities such as time-lags, the resource nexus, and positive feedback loops; global resource governance; and convergence pathways between over-consuming and under-consuming societies. These areas will provide the science that will inform policy and business decisions and guide the engagement of practitioners to work towards sustainability transitions to equitable, sustainable, post-fossil carbon societies.},

So the question needs to be answered if this is finally an attempt to put into practice what was promised 20 years ago, or another diversion from what needs to be accomplished. Sustainable development is still a convincing concept, if the original definition is taken, avoiding the confusion caused by partisan interests reinterpreting the concept. Focussing on human needs fulfilment and respecting environmental limits, it can still guide strong sustainable consumption. Green economy/green growth, on the other hand, is a new terminology for what is known since 40 years as ecological modernisation. It is indeed overdue, but with its focus on efficiency and innovation it cannot guarantee to fulfil the Brundtland sustainability criteria. A factor analysis based on the I~=~P*A*T formula demonstrates how optimistic the assumptions regarding future technologies must be to support the green growth concept. Consequently, the authors pledge for a pragmatic, risk avoiding approach by slimming the physical size of the economy. This requires `strong sustainable consumption' (including production as resource consumption), which in turn requires a change of the societies' institutional settings (formal and informal, mechanisms and orientations). Finally some elements of a strategy towards this end are pointed out, with special emphasis on the role of non-governmental organisations NGOs. Through networking and advocacy they can both stimulate bottom-up action and mobilise the pressure necessary for the institutional changes which are needed to mainstream strong sustainable consumption.},

A wide range of studies and approaches for CBCF have been presented, yet a systematic and interpretative synopsis of the literature is missing. We present a comprehensive review of more than 100 CBCF studies published in Scopusindexed journals until 2019. We analyze the methodological and conceptual development of spatially related CBCFs and provide guidance for future research. While the recent emergence of several global multi-region input-output (MRIO) models has meant remarkable development in assessment accuracy, there is space for improvement in hybrid-modeling and increasing sectoral detail. Furthermore, it was recognized that studies published under the same CBCF label actually fall into two categories with different definitions and potentially significantly different outcomes. We suggest labeling these as Areal CF (ACF) and Personal CF (PCF) in the future. ACF encompasses the CBCF of economic activities within selected geographic boundaries, and the global production and delivery chain emissions of the goods and services consumed therein, including those consumed by visitors. PCF covers the consumption of the residents of the area regardless of where the consumption takes place but excludes the consumption of visitors within the area in question. ACF analyses typically include government consumption and investments, whereas PCF analyses normally exclude these. This scope issue is seldom brought up in individual studies, and it currently takes a lot of effort and expertise to classify existing studies, which hinders their usability for policy-making. In addition, we suggest that future studies position themselves among previous studies on the same location, discuss potential reasons for differences in the results, and consider these when drawing policy conclusions.},

  abstract = {Residential consumption produces carbon emissions through the combustion of primary energy (directly) as well as through the consumption of goods and services (indirectly). To capture the latter indirect emissions, it is common to use producer-price based input-output analysis associated with household monetary expenditures. However, producer-price input-output tables usually do not account for economic transactions and energy flows at the margin. To better understand household indirect emissions from the purchaser perspective, there is a need for a modified input--output modeling approach. To that end, this study attempts to measure the carbon footprint of households in the Tokyo Metropolis, Japan by integrating monthly household consumption inventories into an input--output table of Tokyo. By doing so, the carbon footprint was estimated to be 0.76 tC per household and the total estimated marginal carbon emissions for Tokyo is up to 0.56 MtC. A sectoral breakdown of the total emission coefficients is provided based on purchaser prices and temporal variations in emissions. Findings indicate that within household consumption, Clothing and Services categories contributed most to marginal emissions. The conclusions drawn in this paper are pertinent and policy relevant because they provide relatively accurate information compared to the status quo to inform appropriate policies for guiding residential consumption at the city scale of resolution.},

By comprehensively comparing production- and consumption-based emissions, we found that six developed cities were consumers with import-depended trade patterns, while the five other cities were producers, mostly medium in size, with the potential to transform into consumer cities with socioeconomic development. Emissions embodied in imports accounted for more than half of the consumption-based emissions in most cities, which shows the significance of interregional cooperation in tackling climate change. International cooperation is also important at the city level, as international imports also impact consumptionbased emissions. From the perspective of final use, emissions caused by fixed capital formation predominated in most cities and were determined by their economic development models.},

We show that the Duchin--Levine model contains two different mechanisms by which multiple technologies can arise. If a factor in short supply is shared by the original and the newly entering technology, the output of the original, lower-cost technology will be reduced to make room for the higher-cost technology which is less intensive in that factor. In contrast, if the factor in short supply is technology-specific, a higher-cost technology supplements the original lowest-cost one, which stays fully active. Either mechanism implies a mechanism-specific set of prices, quantities and rents. We relate these results to classical views on comparative advantage, fixed output levels and the origin of rents.},

  abstract = {In 2008, the European Commission (EC) launched the Covenant of Mayors (CoM), a voluntary agreement under which local governments commit to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 20\% within 2020, in order to reinforce local authorities in designing strategies to mitigate climate change in coherence with the European Union's climate policy. The CoM may be defined as a coordinated collection of experiments based on common rules established by the EC. Cities signing the CoM commit to follow guidelines and standardized methodologies in setting CO2 emission reduction targets and in designing and implementing policies and measures to reach them, through the definition of key tools such as the Baseline Emission Inventory (BEI) and the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP). The present study analyses the emission reduction strategies of a sample of 124 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants, signatories of the CoM, which delivered a SEAP by February 2014. More than 5500 actions planned by the sample cities were analysed and categorized. The most relevant actions in terms of recurrence and mitigation impact were assessed. Finally a set of variables was tested through a regression so as to determine their influence on emission reductions strategies. The main results of this study show that the sample cities accounted for a total of 370 million tons of CO2 emissions in selected baseline years and 94 million tons of intended emission reductions per year. The total emission reductions planned by cities reached 25\% of the baseline emissions. Buildings and Transport stood out as the sectors where cities intend to deliver the largest emission reductions. Furthermore the analysis showed that cities' administrations attribute higher potential to actions in subsectors under their direct control (municipal buildings, public transport, municipal fleet and public lighting) compared to actions in subsectors managed by private actors (households and firms). In the Building sector, the category of action delivering the highest share of CO2 emission reductions was represented by integrated actions, which combine several types of intervention so as to maximise the energy efficiency of buildings. In the transport sector, it was the modal shift, which implies a transition from private transport to public and cleaner transport modes. In both the Building and Transport sectors, cities plan to reduce the major amount of CO2 emissions through the implementation of management and organization, infrastructure construction and awareness-raising policy levers. Our results may be useful to urban policy makers to shape their mitigation strategies in coherence with cities' commitments and plans and to replicate policies and actions on the basis of CoM signatories' experiences.},

  abstract = {Urban ecosystems are complex systems with anthropogenic features that generate considerable CO2 emissions, which contributes to global climate change. Quantitative estimates of the carbon footprint of urban ecosystems are crucial for developing low-carbon development policies to mitigate climate change. Herein, we reviewed more than 195 urban carbon footprint and carbon footprint related studies, collated the recent progress in carbon footprint calculation methods and research applications of the urban ecosystem carbon footprint, analyzed the research applications of the carbon footprint of different cities, and focused on the need to study the urban ecosystem carbon footprint from a holistic perspective. Specifically, we aimed to: (i) compare the strengths and weaknesses of five existing carbon footprint calculation methods [life cycle assessment, input--output analysis, hybrid life cycle assessment, carbon footprint calculator, and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)]; (ii) analyze the status of current research on the carbon footprint of different urban subregions based on different features; and (iii) highlight new methods and areas of research on the carbon footprint of future urban ecosystems. Not all carbon footprint accounting methods are applicable to the carbon footprint determination of urban ecosystems; although the IPCC method is more widely used than the others, the hybrid life cycle assessment method is more accurate. With the emergence of new science and technology, quantitative methods to calculate the carbon footprint of urban ecosystems have evolved, becoming more accurate. Further development of new technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence, to assess the carbon footprint of urban ecosystems is anticipated to help address the emerging challenges in urban ecosystem research effectively to achieve carbon neutrality and urban sustainability under global change.},

Here, we develop an approach to interpret carbon footprints of cities by focusing on their system boundaries, double counting recognition, spatial paths and policy sensitivities. Using four megacities in China as a case study, we quantify and map urban carbon footprints from various accounting perspectives: territorial carbon emissions, community-wide infrastructure carbon footprint, consumption-based carbon footprint, wider production carbon footprint, and full-scope carbon footprint. We find that the megacities' infrastructure carbon footprints are dominated by electricity-related emissions, whereas their consumption-based carbon footprints are significantly impacted by imports of both electricity and other products and services. Over 55\% of the full-scope carbon footprints (sums of all three scopes) of Beijing and Shanghai can be attributed to upstream emissions, while in Chongqing and Tianjin territorial emissions are more important. Key urban infrastructure contributes over 70\% to the total carbon emissions in import supply chains, determining the spatial paths and the carbon intensities of imports for these megacities. The main destinations of outsourced carbon emissions across the country from the megacities are found to be similar due to market domination of bulk suppliers of infrastructure-related and other carbon-intensive products. In addition, double counting of certain footprint indicators is considered small in this case, but could be amplified with increasing number of cities being assessed.},

All papers are divided into four themes, including GHG emission inventory and accounting, climate change and urban sectors, climate change and sustainable development, and strategies and mitigation action plans. First, this SV provides methods for constructing emission inventory from both production and consumption perspectives. These methods are useful to improve the comprehensiveness and accuracy of carbon accounting for international cities. Second, the climate change affects urban sectors from various aspects; simultaneously, GHG emissions caused by activities in urban sectors affect the climate system. This SV focuses on mitigation policies and assessment of energy, transport, construction, and service sectors. Third, climate change mitigation of cities is closely connected to urban sustainable development. This SV explores the relationships between climate change mitigation with urbanization, ecosystems, air pollution, and extreme events. Fourth, climate change mitigation policies can be divided into two categories: quantity-based mechanism (e.g., carbon emission trading) and price-based mechanism (e.g., carbon tax). This SV provides experiences of local climate change mitigation all over the world and proposes the city-to-city cooperation on climate change mitigation.},

We conclude that it is possible for cities to get to or near net-zero carbon, but this requires systemic transformation. Crucially, a city cannot achieve net-zero by focusing only on reducing emissions within its administrative boundaries. Cities must decarbonize key transboundary supply chains and use urban and regional landscapes to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. Because of carbon lock-in, and the complex interplay between urban infrastructure and behavior, strategic sequencing of mitigation action is essential for cities to achieve net-zero.},

In this paper we use environmentally-extended input--output tables to: (a) quantify the long-term drivers that have led to diversified energy footprint profiles of 186 countries around the world from 1990 to 2010; (b) identify which countries and sectors recorded an increase or decrease in energy footprints during this time period; (c) highlight the effect of international outsourcing of energy-intensive production processes by decomposing the structural and spatial change in energy footprints; and (d) discuss the implications for national economic policy for the identified drivers. To this end, we use a detailed Multi-Regional Input--Output database and three prevalent structural decomposition analysis methods. To reduce biases in the results due to time lapse and currency variations, we convert input--output tables to common US\$ and 1990-constant prices. This study provides a broad overview of the magnitude and distribution of the drivers for energy footprints across countries. The results of this study demonstrate that for almost all countries affluence and population growth are driving energy footprints worldwide, which is in part counteracted by the retarding effect of industrial energy intensity. In particular, this study demonstrates that with increasing per-capita GDP, the total energy footprint of a country is increasingly concentrated on imports or consumption.},

A phenomenon that has received due attention is the upsurge of emission transfers via international trade. A question that has remained unanswered is whether trade changes have affected global emissions. For each of five factors (one of which is trade changes) in 40 countries we quantify its contribution to the growth in global emissions. We find that the changes in the levels of consumption per capita have led to an enormous growth in emissions (+14.0 Gt). This effect was partly offset by the changes in technology (-8.4 Gt). Smaller effects are found for population growth (+4.2 Gt) and changes in the composition of the consumption (-1.5 Gt). Changes in the trade structure had a very moderate effect on global emissions (+0.6 Gt). Looking at the geographical distribution, changes in the emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia and China) have caused 44\% of emission growth whereas the increase in their national emissions accounted for 59\% of emission growth. This means that 15\% (1.4 Gt) of all extra GHG emissions between 1995 and 2008 have been emitted in emerging countries but were caused by changes in other countries.},

In this paper, we estimate the emission cost of sourcing (ECS), which originates from replacing domestic products by imports from countries with more CO2-intensive technologies. Using a structural decomposition analysis, we find that changes in sourcing patterns between 1995 and 2007 contribute (1) to reducing territorial emissions in high-wage countries (70\% of their territorial emissions growth) and (2) to increasing territorial emissions in lowwage countries (30\% of their territorial emissions increase). The net global effect, the ECS, amounts to 18\% of total global CO2-emissions growth. Our results call the climate change policies based on territorial principles into question given that they disregard that differences in emission intensities between countries contribute to raising global emissions.

A simple model demonstrates how unobserved heterogeneity, endogeneity, and aggregation issues bias standard measurements of this relationship. A reduced-form estimate of the model, using data on U.S. regulations and trade with Canada and Mexico for 130 manufacturing industries from 1977 to 1986, indicates that industries whose abatement costs increased most experienced the largest increases in net imports. For the average industry, the change in net imports we ascribe to regulatory costs amounting to 10\% of the total increase in trade volume over the period.},

  abstract = {Understanding inequality energy consumption at the global level delivers key insights for strategies to mitigate climate change. Recent contributions [4,28,48,49] have studied energy inequality through the lens of maximum entropy. They claim a weighted international distribution of total primary energy demand should approach a BoltzmannGibbs maximum entropy equilibrium distribution in the form of an exponential distribution. This implies convergence to a Gini coefficient of 0.5 from above. The present paper challenges the validity of this claim and critically discusses the applicability of statistical equilibrium reasoning to economics from the viewpoint of social accounting. It is shown that the exponential distribution is only a robust candidate for a statistical equilibrium of energy inequality when employing one particular accounting convention for energy flows, the substitution method. But this method has become problematic with a higher renewable share in the international energy mix, and no other accounting method supports the claim of a convergence to a 0.5 Gini. We conclude that the findings based on maximum entropy reasoning are sensitive to accounting conventions and critically discuss the epistemological implications of this sensitivity for the use of maximum entropy approaches in social sciences.},

  abstract = {In recent years, several measures and policies have been introduced to safeguard healthy NO2 levels in urban areas, including the creation of low emission zones (LEZs). In November 2018, a traffic-restricted area known as the Special Protection Low Emission Zone (SPLEZ) was established in the core of the city of Madrid, embracing most of its central district. This study aims to evaluate whether the implementation of the LEZ has led to improvements in air quality by analyzing NO2 concentrations in various case scenarios. For this purpose, data from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 precursor (Sentinel-5P) were used. The pre- and post-LEZ implementation seasonal analysis (from July 2018 to May 2019) and the entirety of 2022 indicated that the epicenter of transport-related NO2 concentrations did not lie within its boundaries. However, NO2 levels within the SPLEZ peaked during winter, with heating and meteorological factors playing a significant role. Additionally, the findings from the case study of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the influence of human activities on the NO2 concentration in both the SPLEZ and the entire metropolitan area. NO2 emissions decreased during the strict lockdown period and steadily increased as activities resumed. Satellite data was compared to surface-level measurements in each case study, resulting in a linear correlation coefficient of 0.72. TROPOMI data was found to closely align with surface-level observations as pollution levels increased, contrasting with better air quality scenarios. Despite certain limitations, it can serve as a valuable tool for providing complementary information to surface-level data, particularly in characterizing changes in pollution distribution patterns.},

  abstract = {Household consumption has been identified to have an essential role in influencing ultimately the environmental pressures generated by human activities. This study assesses the indirect environmental footprint of the Spanish households applying a combination of consumer expenditure surveys with environmentally extended multi-regional input--output analysis. A total of fourteen environmental impact categories are studied from 2006 to 2015. All the impact categories present a similar trend, particularly affected by the economic crisis. The impacts decreased from 2008 to 2013 and finally slightly started rising again from 2014 to 2015. Results show that the dominant categories influencing the indirect environmental footprint in 2015 are (1) food and beverages, (2) housing, and (3) furnishings. From the intensity perspective, housing, transport, and food and beverages appear to be the most intensive consumption clusters in the Spanish household indirect environmental footprint. In relation to the indirect water impacts embodied in the Spanish households' imports, the largest amount is from European countries and the highest virtual water (59\%) corresponds to food and agriculture, in particular from wheat, fruit, vegetables, and dairy products. The findings obtained in relation to the sources generating indirect impacts from household consumption could aid the implementation of future mitigation policies.},
